TI  - Diffusion MRI fiber diameter for muscle denervation assessment.
PG  - 80-94
LID - 10.21037/qims-21-313 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To develop and evaluate a diffusion MRI-based apparent muscle fiber 
      diameter (AFD) method in patients with muscle denervation. It was hypothesized 
      that AFD differences between denervated, non-denervated and control muscles would 
      be greater than those from standard diffusion metrics. METHODS: A spin-echo 
      diffusion acquisition with multi-b-valued diffusion sampling was used. An 
      orientation-invariant dictionary approach utilized a cylinder-based forward model 
      and multi-compartment model for obtaining restricted and free fractions. 
      Simulations were performed to determine precision, bias, and optimize dictionary 
      parameters. In all, 18 exams of patients with muscle denervation and 8 exams of 
      healthy subjects were performed at 3T. Six regions of interests (ROIs) within 
      separate shoulder muscles were selected, yielding three groups consisting 47 
      control (healthy), 36 non-denervated (patients), and 68 denervated (patients) 
      muscle ROIs. Two-sample t-tests (α=0.05) between groups were performed with 
      Holm-Bonferroni correction. T(2)- and fat fraction (FF)-mapping were acquired for 
      comparison. RESULTS: Mean AFD was 89.7±13.6 µm in control, 71.6±15.3 µm in 
      non-denervated, and 60.7±15.9 µm in denervated muscles and were significantly 
      different (P<0.001) in paired comparisons and in 10/12 individual muscle region 
      comparisons. Correlation between AFD and FF (-0.331, P<0.001) was low, but 
      correlation between FA and FF was negligible (0.197, P=0.016). Correlation was 
      low between AFD and T(2) (-0.395, P<0.001) and between FA and T(2) (0.359, 
      P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion MRI-based AFD complements T2- and FF-mapping 
      techniques to non-invasively assess muscle denervation.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted MRI to determine response and long-term clinical outcomes in 
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
PG  - 961393
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.961393 [doi]
LID - 961393
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine local treatment response and long-term 
      survival outcomes in patients with localised muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
      (MIBC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using diffusion-weighted 
      MRI (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) analysis. METHODS: Patients 
      with T2-T4aN0-3M0 bladder cancer suitable for NAC were recruited prospectively. 
      DWI was performed prior to NAC and was repeated following NAC completion. 
      Conventional response assessment was performed with cystoscopy and tumour site 
      biopsy. Response was dichotomised into response (<T2) or poor response (≥T2). 
      Patients proceeded to either radical cystectomy or chemo-radiotherapy as standard 
      of care. Tumour ADC values were calculated for all b-values (ADC(all)) and high 
      b-values (ADC(b100)). Mean ADC, percentiles, skew, kurtosis, and their change 
      (ΔADC and %ΔADC) were determined. Threshold predictive of response with highest 
      specificity was ascertained using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      analysis. Median overall survival (OS), bladder-cancer-specific survival (bCSS), 
      progression-free survival (PFS), and time to cystectomy were estimated using 
      Kaplan-Meier method. Significant area under the curve (AUC) cut points were used 
      to determine relationship with long-term endpoints and were compared using 
      log-rank test. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (96 DWI) were evaluated. NAC 
      response was associated with significant increase in mean ΔADC and %ΔADC compared 
      to poor response (ΔADC(all) 0.32×10(-3) versus 0.11×10(-3) mm(2)/s; p=0.009, and 
      %ΔADC(all) 21.70% versus 8.23%; p=0.013). Highest specificity predicting response 
      was seen at 75th percentile ADC (AUC, 0.8; p=0.01). Sensitivity, specificity, 
      positive predictive power, and negative predictive power of %ΔADC(b100) 75th 
      percentile was 73.7%, 90.0%, 96.6%, and 52.9%, respectively. %ΔADC(b100) 75th 
      percentile >15.5% was associated with significant improvement in OS (HR, 0.40; 
      95% CI, 0.19-0.86; p=0.0179), bCSS (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.82; p=0.0214), PFS 
      (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05-0.48; p=0.0012), and time to cystectomy (HR, 0.19; 95% 
      CI, 0.07-0.47; p=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative ADC analysis can successfully 
      identify NAC response and improved long-term clinical outcomes. Multi-centre 
      validation to assess reproducibility and repeatability is required before testing 
      within clinical trials to inform MIBC treatment decision making. ADVANCES IN 
      KNOWLEDGE: We successfully demonstrated that measured change in DWI can 
      successfully identify NAC response and improved long-term survival outcomes.

LID - 19676
AB  - To evaluate differences in qMRI parameters of muscle diffusion tensor imaging 
      (mDTI), fat-fraction (FF) and water T2 time in leg muscles of calpainopathy 
      patients (LGMD R1/D4) compared to healthy controls, to correlate those findings 
      to clinical parameters and to evaluate if qMRI parameters show muscle 
      degeneration in not-yet fatty infiltrated muscles. We evaluated eight thigh and 
      seven calf muscles of 19 calpainopathy patients and 19 healthy matched controls. 
      MRI scans were performed on a 3T MRI including a mDTI, T2 mapping and mDixonquant 
      sequence. Clinical assessment was done with manual muscle testing, patient 
      questionnaires (ACTIVLIM, NSS) as well as gait analysis. Average FF was 
      significantly different in all muscles compared to controls (p < 0.001). In 
      muscles with less than 8% FF a significant increase of FA (p < 0.005) and 
      decrease of RD (p < 0.004) was found in high-risk muscles of calpainopathy 
      patients. Water T2 times were increased within the low- and intermediate-risk 
      muscles (p ≤ 0.045) but not in high-risk muscles (p = 0.062). Clinical 
      assessments correlated significantly with qMRI values: QMFM vs. FF: r = - 0.881, 
      p < 0.001; QMFM versus FA: r = - 0.747, p < 0.001; QMFM versus MD: r = 0.942, 
      p < 0.001. A good correlation of FF and diffusion metrics to clinical assessments 
      was found. Diffusion metrics and T2 values are promising candidates to serve as 
      sensitive early and non-invasive methods to capture early muscle degeneration in 
      non-fat-infiltrated muscles in calpainopathies.

TI  - Intersession Repeatability of Diffusion-Tensor Imaging in the Supraspinatus and 
      the Infraspinatus Muscles of Volunteers.
LID - 10.1002/jmri.28424 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantifying the rotator cuff (RC) muscles' viscoelasticity could 
      provide outcome relevant information in patients with RC tears. MR-elastography 
      requires robust diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) to account for tissue anisotropy 
      in muscles stiffness computation. PURPOSE: To assess the repeatability of DTI 
      parameters in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles and to explore DTI 
      tractography conformity with the muscles' anatomy. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. 
      SUBJECTS: Six healthy volunteers underwent three consecutive shoulder MRI 
      sessions about 10 minutes apart. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T/T1-vibe Dixon and 
      Spin echo EPI DTI (12 gradient encoding directions, b-values 500 and 
      800 sec/mm(2) ). ASSESSMENT: Supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles were 
      segmented on the T1-vibe Dixon sequence. DTI image quality was assessed using a 
      quantitative threshold based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The eigenvalues 
      ( λ1, λ2, λ3 ), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity were calculated. 
      DTI tractography was visually assessed. STATISTICAL TESTS: DTI parameters 
      within-subject intersession repeatability was assessed with Bland-Altman analysis 
      and the coefficient of variation (CV). Repeatability was considered good for 
      CV < 10%. RESULTS: The SNR between diffusion-weighted and non-diffusion-weighted 
      images was greater than 3, which aligns with standards for estimating DTI 
      parameters. The FA showed the lowest mean bias (-0.007; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] -0.031 to 0.018) whereas the λ(1) had the highest mean bias (0.146 × 10(-3) 
       mm(2) /sec; CI -0.034 to 0.326 × 10(-3)  mm(2) /sec). CVs of the DTI parameters 
      varied between 3.5% (FA) and 8.4% (λ(3) ) for the supraspinatus and between 3.2% 
      (λ(1) ) and 6.8% (λ(3) ) for the infraspinatus. Tractography provided muscle 
      fiber representations in three-dimensional space concordant with RC anatomy. DATA 
      CONCLUSION: DTI of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles achieved an 
      adequate SNR, allowing the measurement of the DTI metrics with good 
      repeatability, and thus can be used for optimizing stiffness estimation in these 
      anisotropic tissues. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

TI  - Near-Silent and Distortion-Free Diffusion MRI in Pediatric Musculoskeletal 
      Disorders: Comparison With Echo Planar Imaging Diffusion.
PG  - 504-513
LID - 10.1002/jmri.27330 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is common for evaluating pediatric 
      musculoskeletal lesions, but suffers from geometric distortion and intense 
      acoustic noise. PURPOSE: To investigate the performance of a near-silent and 
      distortion-free DWI sequence (DW-SD) relative to standard echo-planar DWI 
      (DW-EPI) in pediatric extremity MRI. STUDY TYPE: Prospective validation study. 
      SUBJECTS: Thirty-nine children referred for extremity MRI. FIELD 
      STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: DW-EPI and DW-SD, based on a rotating ultrafast sequence 
      modified with sinusoidal diffusion preparation gradients, at 3T. ASSESSMENT: 
      DW-SD image quality (S(anat) ) was assessed from 0 (nondiagnostic) to 5 
      (outstanding) and comparative image quality (S(comp) ) (from -2 = DW-EPI more 
      delineated to +2 = DW-SD more delineated, 0 = same). ADC measured by DW-SD and 
      DW-EPI were compared in bone marrow, muscle, and lesions. STATISTICAL TESTS: 
      Wilcoxon rank-sum test and confidence interval of proportions (CIOP) were 
      calculated for S(comp) , Student's t-test, coefficient of variation (COV), and 
      Bland-Altman analysis for ADC values, and intraclass correlation coefficient 
      (ICC) for interreader agreement. RESULTS: DW-SD and DW-EPI ADC values for bone 
      marrow, muscle, and lesions were not significantly different (P = 0.3, P = 0.2, 
      and P = 0.27, respectively) and had an overall ADC COV of 14.8% (95% confidence 
      interval: 12.3%, 16.9%) and no significant proportional bias on Bland-Altman 
      analysis. S(anat) CIOP was rated diagnostic or better (score of 3, 4, or 5) in 
      72-98% of cases for bone marrow, muscle, and soft tissues. DW-SD was equivalent 
      to or preferred over DW-EPI in muscles and soft tissues, with CIOP 86-93% and 
      93%, respectively. Lesions were equally visualized on DW-SD and DW-EPI in 40-51%, 
      with DW-SD preferred in 44-56% of cases. DW-SD was rated significantly better 
      than DW-EPI across all comparative variables that included bone marrow, muscle, 
      soft tissue, cartilage, and lesions (P < 0.05). Readers had moderate to 
      near-perfect (ICC range = 0.45-0.85). DATA CONCLUSION: DW-SD of the extremities 
      provided similar ADC values and improved image quality compared with conventional 
      DW-EPI. Level of Evidence 2 Technical Efficacy Stage 2 J. MAGN. RESON. IMAGING

AB  - AIM: To characterise the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) features, in particular the functional MRI characteristics, of extraocular 
      muscle granular cell tumours (GCTs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CT (n=6) and MRI 
      (n=8) features of eight extraocular muscle GCTs cofirmed at histopathology were 
      analysed retrospectively. The imaging findings were evaluated with emphasis on 
      the location, size, margin, shape, extent, bony change, internal architecture, 
      enhancement pattern, and extent of lesions. Based on diffusion-weighted imaging 
      (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, the apparent diffusion coefficient 
      (ADC) value of six lesions and time-intensity curve (TIC) of one lesion were 
      reviewed. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed strong positivity for S-100 
      protein and a low Ki-67 index (2-5%) in all cases. Most of the lesions (7/8) were 
      confined to the muscle belly with an ovoid shape. All of the tumours were 
      isodense to cerebral grey matter and showed homogeneously mild enhancement on CT 
      images. All lesions were hypointense to cerebral grey matter on T2-weighted 
      imaging (T2WI) and showed homogeneously marked enhancement on contrast-enhanced 
      T1-weighted imaging (T1WI). All lesions showed a hypo- or isointense signal on 
      DWI images with a high b-value. The mean ADC of six lesions was 
      (0.72 ± 0.14) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s. The TIC of the case examined using DCE-MRI showed 
      a plateau pattern (type II). CONCLUSION: A well-defined oval mass confined to the 
      muscle belly with a hypointense signal on T2WI, homogeneously marked enhancement 
      on contrast-enhanced T1WI, hypo- or isointense signal on DWI, and low ADC value 
      is highly suggestive of a GCT.

TI  - Different Attenuation Models of Diffusion-Weighted MR Imaging for the 
      Differentiation of Benign and Malignant Musculoskeletal Tumors.
PG  - 594-607
LID - 10.1002/jmri.27887 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several functional imaging techniques, including monoexponential 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (m-DWI), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and 
      diffusion kurtosis (DK) imaging, have been used in differentiating benign and 
      malignant musculoskeletal tumors. Combining all three techniques in the same 
      study population may improve differentiation. PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic 
      performance of m-DWI, IVIM, and DK models and their combinations in 
      differentiating benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors. STUDY TYPE: 
      Prospective. POPULATION: Fifty patients with benign and malignant musculoskeletal 
      tumors divided into nonmyxoid and nonchondroid and myxoid and/or chondroid 
      subgroups. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 1.5 T/m-DWI, IVIM, and DK single-shot 
      spin-echo echo-planar sequences. ASSESSMENT: Minimum and volumetric values of 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), pure molecular diffusion (D(ivim) ), 
      pseudodiffusion (D*), perfusion fraction (f), diffusion coefficient for kurtosis 
      model (D(K) ), and Kurtosis (K) were compared between all benign and malignant 
      tumors. Subgroup analysis was also performed for nonmyxoid and nonchondroid and 
      myxoid and/or chondroid tumors. STATISTICAL TESTS: Independent samples t-test, 
      Mann-Whitney U test, intraclass correlation coefficient, ROC analysis, and 
      logistic regression analysis. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically 
      significant. RESULTS: ADC(min) , D(ivim-min) , D*(vol) , D(K-min,) K(vol,) and 
      K(min) values showed statistically significant differences between all benign and 
      malignant tumors and nonmyxoid and nonchondroid tumor subgroup. K(min) showed the 
      highest diagnostic performance in differentiating benign and malignant tumors 
      with AUCs of 0.760 for "all tumors" and 0.825 for the nonmyxoid and nonchondroid 
      tumor subgroup. No significant differences were detected in m-DWI-, IVIM-, and 
      DK-derived parameters for differentiating benign and malignant myxoid and/or 
      chondroid tumors. Only three of 63 combinations of prediction models demonstrated 
      a higher diagnostic performance than K(min) ; however, improvements were not 
      significantly different. DATA CONCLUSION: ADC(min) , D(ivim-min) , D*(vol) , 
      D(K-min) , K(vol) , and K(min) values can be used to differentiate benign and 
      malignant musculoskeletal tumors. Our findings suggest that the added value of 
      multiparametric approach in such differentiation is not significant. EVIDENCE

PG  - 3192-3200
LID - 10.1002/mrm.28945 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the diffusion time-dependence in muscle in healthy adult 
      volunteers, boys with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD), and age-matched 
      controls in a clinically feasible acquisition time for pediatric applications. 
      METHODS: Diffusion data were acquired using a pulsed gradient stimulated echo 
      diffusion preparation at 5 different diffusion times (70, 130, 190, 250, and 330 
      ms), at 4 different b-values (0, 200, 400, 600, and 800 s/mm(2) ) and 6 
      directions (orthogonal x, y, and z and diagonal xy, xz, and yz) and processed to 
      obtain standard diffusion indices (mean diffusivity [MD] and fractional 
      anisotropy [FA]) at each diffusion time. RESULTS: Time-dependent diffusion was 
      seen in muscle in healthy adult volunteers, boys with DMD, and age-matched 
      controls. Boys with DMD showed reduced MD and increased FA values in comparison 
      to age matched controls across a range of diffusion times. A diffusion time of Δ 
      = 190 ms had the largest effect size. CONCLUSIONS: These results could be used to 
      optimize diffusion imaging in this disease further and imply that these diffusion 
      indices may become an important biomarker in monitoring progression in DMD in the 
      future.

LID - 239
AB  - BACKGROUND: To explore the value of magnetic resonance quantitative analysis 
      using diffusion tensor imaging, T2 mapping, and intravoxel incoherent motion in 
      the evaluation of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage and to compare the 
      effects of various eccentric exercise modes at different time points in rats. 
      METHODS: A total of 174 Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into five 
      groups: control, once-only exercise, continuous exercise, intermittent exercise, 
      and once-fatigue exercise groups. Each experimental group was divided into seven 
      time-subgroups: 0.5 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, 120 h and 168 h after exercise. 
      The quadriceps femoris muscles were then scanned using magnetic resonance 
      imaging. The apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy values of 
      diffusion tensor imaging, T2 values of T2 mapping, D and D* values of intravoxel 
      incoherent motion and optical density values of desmin were measured. 
      Associations among different eccentric exercise programmes, magnetic resonance 
      imaging findings, and histopathological results were evaluated. Dunnett's test, 
      two-way repeated measures analysis of variance, and Pearson correlation analysis 
      were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Diffusion tensor imaging showed that 
      the number of muscle fibre bundles decreased to varying degrees with different 
      time points and eccentric exercises. Apparent diffusion coefficient values of the 
      exercise groups showed a trend that first increased and then decreased, the 
      opposite of fractional anisotropy. The specimens in all eccentric exercise 
      programmes showed high signal T2 values after exercise, the highest among which 
      was in the once-fatigue exercise group. D and D* in the experimental groups were 
      significantly higher than those in the control group at 0.5-48 h after exercise. 
      The apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, T2, D and D* values 
      correlated with the optical density values of desmin. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion 
      tensor imaging, T2 mapping, and intravoxel incoherent motion technology 
      accurately reflect the degree of skeletal muscle damage and recovery associated 
      with eccentric exercise. The degree of muscle damage was the lowest in the 
      continuous exercise group and the highest in the once-fatigue exercise group, 
      which may provide more information and guidance for the formulation of physical 
      and athletic training programmes.

AB  - Diffusion-tensor MRI fiber tractography has been used to reconstruct skeletal 
      muscle architecture, but remains a specialized technique using custom-written 
      data processing routines. In this work, we describe the public release of a 
      software toolbox having the following design objectives: accomplish the 
      pre-processing tasks of file input, image registration, denoising, and 
      diffusion-tensor calculation; allow muscle-specific methods for defining seed 
      points; make fiber-tract architectural measurements referenced to tendinous 
      structures; visualize fiber tracts and other muscle structures of interest; 
      analyze the goodness of outcomes; and provide a programming structure that allows 
      the addition of new capabilities in future versions. The proper function of the 
      code was verified using simulated datasets. The toolbox capabilities for 
      characterizing human muscle structure in vivo were demonstrated in a case study. 
      These capabilities included measurements of muscle morphology; contractile and 
      non-contractile tissue volumes; fiber-tract length, pennation angle, curvature; 
      and the physiological cross-sectional area,. The free public release of this 
      software is a first step in creating of a community of users who use these tools 
      in studies of muscle physiology and biomechanics. Users may further contribute to 
      code development. Along with simulated and actual datasets for benchmarking, 
      these tools will further create mechanisms for enhancing scientific rigor and 
      developing and validating new code features. Planned future developments include 
      additional options for image pre-processing, development of a graphical user 
      interface, analysis of architectural patterns during muscle contraction, and 
      integration of functional imaging data.

TI  - Evaluation of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and 
      diffusion-weighted imaging for predicting muscular hyperplasia/hypertrophy in 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1714-1724
LID - 10.1007/s00261-022-03422-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The existence of smooth muscle alteration in Crohn's disease (CD) is 
      often neglected. It has been found that muscular hyperplasia/hypertrophy rather 
      than fibrosis was the primary component of bowel wall thickening. This study 
      aimed to assess the value of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging 
      (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging for the characterization of 
      histopathologic tissue composition of CD, particularly smooth muscle hypertrophy, 
      as well as inflammation and fibrosis. METHODS: The study included patients 
      diagnosed with CD who received MRI examination 30 days before resection from 
      August 2016 to December 2020. A semiquantitative histological grading scheme was 
      employed to evaluate the pathological tissues. Resected sections were matched 
      with MRI according to pathological marks. Parameters evaluated included: mural 
      thickness, T2 ratio, apparent diffusion coefficient value; and maximum 
      enhancement, initial slope of increase, perfusion parameters of DCE-MRI and 
      enhancement pattern. These parameters were compared with location-matched 
      histopathological grade. RESULTS: Ninety-one sections were enrolled in this 
      retrospective study. When active inflammation is moderate or severe, volume 
      transfer coefficient (K(trans)), maximum enhancement (ME) and initial slope of 
      increase (ISI) are lower, mural thickness is higher when a certain degree of 
      smooth muscle alteration is present. When active inflammation is absent or mild, 
      ME, mural thickness and ISI can differentiate the presence of predominant 
      muscular alteration. By combining ME and thickness comparisons against their 
      cutoff values to create a combined ordinal parameter, the area under the curve 
      value for whether significant muscular alteration coexists with moderate or 
      severe active inflammation was found to be 0.953. CONCLUSIONS: MRI predicts the 
      degree of inflammation, and can distinguish the degree of muscular alteration 
      coexists with moderate or severe active inflammation with reasonable accuracy.

TI  - The diagnostic value of T2 map, diffusion tensor imaging, and diffusion kurtosis 
      imaging in differentiating dermatomyositis from muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 467-473
LID - 10.1177/0284185121999006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dermatomyositis (DM) and muscular dystrophy are clinically difficult 
      to differentiate. PURPOSE: To confirm the feasibility and assess the accuracy of 
      conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), T2 map, diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI), and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in the differentiation of DM from 
      muscular dystrophy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with DM proven by 
      diagnostic criteria were enrolled in the study along with 23 patients with 
      muscular dystrophy. Conventional MR, T2 map, DTI, and DKI images were obtained in 
      the thigh musculature for all patients. Intramuscular T2 value, apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), 
      and mean kurtosis (MK) values were compared between the patients with DM and 
      muscular dystrophy. Student's t-tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curve analyses were performed for all parameters. P values < 0.05 were considered 
      statistically significant. RESULTS: The intramuscular T2, ADC, FA, MD, and MK 
      values within muscles were statistically significantly different between the DM 
      and muscular dystrophy groups (P<0.01). The MK value was statistically 
      significantly different between the groups in comparison with T2 and FA value. As 
      a supplement to conventional MRI, the parameters of MD and MK differentiated DM 
      and muscular dystrophy may be valuable. The optimal cut-off value of ADC and MD 
      values (with respective AUC, sensitivity, and specificity) between DM and 
      muscular dystrophy were 1.698 ×10(-3)mm(2)/s (0.723, 54.1%, and 78.1%) and 1.80 
      ×10(-3)mm(2)/s (61.9% and 70.2%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Thigh muscle ADC and 
      MD parameters may be useful in differentiating patients with DM from those with 
      muscular dystrophy.

AB  - AIM: To determine whether quantitative parameters derived from conventional 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and 
      dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) correlate with the 
      Ki67 proliferation status in musculoskeletal tumours. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Twenty-eight patients with musculoskeletal tumours diagnosed via surgical 
      specimen histological analysis who underwent standard DWI, IVIM, and DCE were 
      reviewed retrospectively. The mean standard DWI (apparent diffusion coefficient 
      [ADC]), IVIM (pure diffusion coefficient [D], pseudo-diffusion coefficient [D∗] 
      and perfusion fraction [ƒ]), and DCE (volume transfer constant [K(trans)], rate 
      constant [K(ep)], and extravascular extracellular volume fraction [V(e)]) 
      parameters were measured and correlated with the Ki67 index. The Ki67 value was 
      categorised as high (>20%) or low (≤20%). RESULTS: The ADC and D values 
      correlated negatively with the Ki67 index (r=-0.711∼-0.699, p<0.001), whereas the 
      K(trans) and K(ep) values correlated positively with the Ki67 index 
      (r=0.389-0.434, p=0.021, 0.041). The ADC and D values were lower (p<0.001), 
      whereas the K(trans) and K(ep) values were higher (p=0.011, 0.005) in 
      musculoskeletal tumours with a high Ki67 status than in those in a low status. 
      The ADC and D demonstrated the largest area under the receiver-operating 
      characteristic curve (AUC = 0.953), which is statistically bigger than the AUC of 
      K(trans) and K(ep) (0.784 and 0.802, respectively). CONCLUSION: ADC, D, K(trans), 
      and K(ep) correlate with the Ki67 index. ADC and D are the strongest quantitative 
      parameters for predicting Ki67 status.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate proven soft tissue musculoskeletal malignancies blinded to their 
      Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer histologic grades to 
      identify the predictive values of conventional MR findings and best fit region of 
      interest (ROI) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Fifty-one consecutive patients with different histologic grades were 
      evaluated by four readers (R1-4) of different experience levels. Quantitatively, 
      the maximum longitudinal size, tumor to muscle signal intensity ratios, and ADC 
      measurements and, qualitatively, the spatial location of the tumor, its signal 
      alterations, heterogeneity, intralesional hemorrhage or fat, and types of 
      enhancement were assessed. Intraclass correlation, weighted kappa, ANOVA, and 
      Fisher exact tests were used. RESULTS: There were 22/51 (43%) men (mean 
      age ± SD = 52 ± 16 years) and 29/51 (57%) women (mean age ± SD = 54± 17 years), 
      with the majority of tumors 38/51 (75%) in the lower extremities. Histologic 
      grades were I in 8/51 (16%), II in 17/51 (33%), and III in 26/51 (51%), 
      respectively. The longitudinal dimensions were different among three grades 
      (p = 0.0015), largest with grade I. More central enhancements and deep locations 
      were seen in grade III tumors (p = 0.0191, 0.0246). The ADC mean was 
      significantly lower in grade III than in grade I or II (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.04). 
      The ADC min was significantly lower in grade III than in grade I (p = 0.02). Good 
      to excellent agreements were seen for T1/T2 tumor/muscle ratios, longitudinal 
      dimension, and ADC (ICC = 0.60-0.98). CONCLUSION: Longitudinal tumor dimension, 
      central enhancement, and ADC values differentiate histology grades in 
      musculoskeletal soft tissue malignancy with good to excellent inter-reader 
      reliability. KEY POINTS: • The longitudinal tumor dimension of grade III 
      malignancy is smaller than that of grade I (p < 0.0001), and higher-grade tumors 
      are located deeper (p = 0.0246). • The ADC mean is significantly lower in grade 
      III than in grade I or grade II (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.04). • The ADC minimum is 
      significantly lower in grade III than in grade I (p = 0.02).

TI  - Multi-Sequence and Multi-Regional MRI-Based Radiomics Nomogram for the 
      Preoperative Assessment of Muscle Invasion in Bladder Cancer.
LID - 10.1002/jmri.28498 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether bladder cancer (BCa) invades muscle is a determinant of 
      management. However, the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis of muscle invasion is 
      not satisfactory. PURPOSE: To investigate the value of multi-sequence and 
      multi-regional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics nomogram for 
      assessing muscle invasion of BCa. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: 342 BCa 
      patients, divided into a training set (239 cases), a validation set (68 cases), 
      and a test set (35 cases). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0 T/T(2) -weighted image, 
      diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. ASSESSMENT: 
      Patients were divided into muscle-invasive (79 cases) and non-muscle-invasive 
      (263 cases). Two radiologists delineated the whole tumor, tumor body, and muscle 
      layer of BCa, respectively, and extracted radiomic features. STATISTICAL TESTS: 
      Recursive feature elimination, Pearson correlation coefficient, logistic 
      regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression 
      analysis, and 5-fold cross-validation were used to screen features and build a 
      radiomics model. The clinical data were collected to construct a clinical model 
      and a radiomics-clinical nomogram. RESULTS: 23,688 features were extracted. After 
      screening, the radiomics scoring model was constructed using nine radiomics 
      features with area under curve (AUC) values of 0.933, 0.913, and 0.931 in the 
      training, validation, and test sets, respectively. The clinical model was 
      constructed using five clinical independent risk factors; the AUC values in the 
      training, validation, and test set were 0.876, 0.859, and 0.824, respectively. 
      After logistic regression analysis, the AUC values of the radiomics-clinical 
      nomogram were made up of four clinical independent risk factors and radiomics 
      scores were 0.955, 0.922, and 0.935 for the training, validation, and test sets, 
      respectively. The DeLong test between clinical model and radiomics-clinical 
      nomogram shows P < 0.001. CONCLUSION: Multi-sequence and multi-regional MRI-based 
      radiomics models could effectively assess the state of BCa muscular invasion. The 
      radiomics-clinical nomogram is superior to clinical model for assessing BCa 
      muscular invasion. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate and compare the diagnostic accuracy and discriminative power 
      of biparametric MRI (bp-MRI) and multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) in predicting 
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) based on Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data 
      System (VI-RADS) scoring and evaluate potentially influencing factors on both 
      protocols' accuracy. METHOD: This retrospective study included 54 bladder cancer 
      (BC) patients who underwent bladder MRI and histo-pathological assessment. Three 
      readers independently reviewed the MRI studies and assigned a 1-5 score for 
      T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced images. Then, 
      bp-MRI and mp-MRI final VI-RADS scores were recorded for each BC. Diagnostic 
      tables, chi-square test, kappa score (k), logistic regression, receiver operating 
      characteristics (ROC) curves, areas under the curves (AUCs), and VI-RADS cut-off 
      values were calculated. A Delong test was performed for ROC curve comparison. A 
      P-value<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In predicting MIBC, bp-MRI and 
      mp-MRI had comparable diagnostic accuracy with insignificant differences for the 
      three readers (P = 0.364,0.718,0.702). Radiologists' experience, and tumors' size 
      and morphology had insignificant effect on bp-MRI accuracy (P = 0.086, 
      0.392,0.294), respectively. Tumors' size significantly influenced mp-MRI accuracy 
      (P = 0.039). Bp-MRI and mp-MRI had comparable discriminative power with 
      insignificant differences for all readers (P > 0.05). Using VI-RADS > 3 cut-off 
      value improved the discriminative power of bp-MRI. Excellent inter-reader 
      agreement in VI-RADS scoring for bp-MRI (k range, 0.814-0.867) and mp-MRI (k 
      range, 0.787-0.859) was observed. CONCLUSION: Bp-MRI and mp-MRI demonstrated 
      comparable diagnostic accuracy and discriminative power in predicting MIBC. The 
      accuracy of bp-MRI was not influenced by radiologists' experience, or tumors' 
      size and morphology.

      perfusion quantification of denervated muscle in rabbits.
PG  - 33-40
LID - 10.1007/s00256-011-1108-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess denervated muscle perfusion 
      using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI (DSCMRI) and contrast-enhanced 
      ultrasound (CEUS), and to measure denervated muscle apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) on b1000 diffusion-weighted MRI (DWMRI) at 3 T in order to 
      clarify whether muscle denervation leads to an increase in the extracellular 
      extravascular space, or an increase in blood flow-or both. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Axotomy of the right sciatic nerve of six white rabbits was performed at day 0. 
      At day 9, hind limb muscles MRI and CEUS were performed to assess the 
      consequences of denervation and both semimembranosus muscles of each rabbit were 
      explanted for histological studies. Signal intensity on T2- and T1-weighted MRI, 
      ADC on DWMRI, maximum signal drop (MSD) on DSCMRI and the area under the curve 
      (AUC) on CEUS were measured over circular regions of interest (ROI), in both 
      semimembranosus muscles. Non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests were used to 
      assess the mean differences between denervated and normal muscles. RESULTS: T2 
      fat-saturated (FS) MRI studies showed a strong signal in the right 
      semimembranosus muscles compared with the left side, and gadolinium enhancement 
      was observed on T1 FS MRI. Denervated muscles show a significant increase in ADC 
      on DWMRI (p < 0.01) and a significant signal enhancement on DSCMR imaging 
      (p < 0.05) and on first-pass CEUS (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this 
      study--based on perfusion- and diffusion-weighted images--suggest that, after 
      denervation, both increased blood flow through muscle tissue and expansion of the 
      extracellular water volume are present.

TI  - Comparison of the diagnostic accuracy and validity of biparametric MRI and 
      multiparametric MRI-based VI-RADS scoring in bladder cancer; is contrast material 
      really necessary in detecting muscle invasion?
PG  - 771-780
LID - 10.1007/s00261-021-03383-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: (1) To evaluate the accuracy and validity of the biparametric MRI 
      (bp-MRI), including T2-weigthed image (WI) and DWI sequences, and the 
      availability of an alternative to the multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI), for the 
      muscle-invasiveness assessment of bladder cancer (BC). (2) To evaluate the 
      diagnostic performance and agreement of readers with different experiences in the 
      abdominal imaging of using both protocols. METHODS: Preoperative bladder mp-MRI 
      was performed on 128 patients with a initial diagnosis of BC. Two sets of images, 
      set 1 (bp-MRI) and set 2 (mp-MRI), were independently evaluated by both readers. 
      Descriptive statistics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area 
      under the curve (AUC), for VI-RADS scores were calculated using ≥ 4 as the cutoff 
      for muscle invasion for each reader and image sets. Inter-reader agreement was 
      evaluated using the Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: The sensitivity ranged 
      between 90.3-93.5% and 87.1-90.3%, specificity ranged between 96.6-99.1% and 
      91.6-96.6%, accuracy ranged between 96-97.3% and 91.3-94.6%, and AUC ranged 
      between 0.947-0.951 and 0.919-0.921, for bp-MRI and mp-MRI, and reader 1 and 
      reader 2, respectively. No significant differences were shown in diagnostic 
      performance for either reader between both the protocols (p = 0.238 and 0.318). 
      There was excellent agreement among the readers in the VI-RADS scores, using both 
      protocols. CONCLUSION: A bp-MRI protocol has a diagnostic accuracy comparable to 
      an mp-MRI protocol for the detection of muscle-invasive BC using the VI-RADS 
      criteria. Also, in both MRI protocols, the reader's experience does not appear to 
      significantly affect diagnostic performance when using the VI-RADS criteria.

AB  - The fiber structure of tissue in meat and seafood has a significant impact on 
      their perceived quality. However, quantifiable description of muscle structure is 
      challenging. We investigate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) as a method to quantitatively describe tissue structure. DTI 
      measures the anisotropy of water molecule diffusion within muscle fibers. A pilot 
      study evaluated three different cod loin samples: one of high-quality, one of 
      medium-quality, and one of poor-quality. DTI parameters such as fractional 
      anisotropy, axial diffusion and radial diffusion showed clear differences between 
      the sample qualities. Changes in the DTI metrics consistent with freezing and 
      thawing damage to the tissue were observed. The DTI maps were compared to 
      T(2)-weighted images and DTI detected significant details that were not visible 
      in T(2)-weighted images. Overall, these results indicate that DTI is a promising 
      method for spatially-resolved characterization of tissue structure in seafood and 
      meat.

      Biopsies.
PG  - 669-678
LID - 10.3233/JND-210641 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle biopsy is one of the gold standards in the diagnostic 
      workup of muscle disorders. By histopathologic analysis, characteristic features 
      like inflammatory cellular infiltrations, fat and collagen replacement of muscle 
      tissue or structural defects of the myofibers can be detected. In the past years, 
      novel quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques have been developed to quantify tissue 
      parameters, thus providing a non-invasive diagnostic tool in several myopathies. 
      OBJECTIVE: This proof-of-principle study was performed to validate the 
      qMRI-techniques to skeletal muscle biopsy results. METHODS: Ten patients who 
      underwent skeletal muscle biopsy for diagnostic purposes were examined by qMRI. 
      Fat fraction, water T2-time and diffusion parameters were measured in the muscle 
      from which the biopsy was taken. The proportion of fat tissue, the severity of 
      degenerative and inflammatory parameters and the amount of type 1- and type 2- 
      muscle fibers were determined in all biopsy samples. The qMRI-data were then 
      correlated to the histopathological findings. RESULTS: The amount of fat tissue 
      in skeletal muscle biopsy correlated significantly with the fat fraction derived 
      from the Dixon sequence. The water T2-time, a parameter for tissue edema, 
      correlated with the amount of vacuolar changes of myofibers and endomysial 
      macrophages in the histopathologic analysis. No significant correlations were 
      found for diffusion parameters. CONCLUSION: In this proof-of-principle study, 
      qMRI techniques were related to characteristic histopathologic features in 
      neuromuscular disorders. The study provides the basis for further development of 
      qMRI methods in the follow-up of patients with neuromuscular disorders, 
      especially in the context of emerging treatment strategies.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted MRI for detection and differentiation of musculoskeletal 
      tumorous and tumor-like lesions in pediatric patients.
PG  - 342-9
LID - 10.1007/s12519-012-0379-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MRI is the diagnostic mainstay for detection and differentiation of 
      musculoskeletal tumors. However, a projection regarding the biological dignity of 
      lesions based on standard MRI sequences remains difficult and uncertain. This 
      study was undertaken to analyse whether diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) can 
      distinguish between benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumorous and tumor-like 
      lesions in pediatric patients. METHODS: MR examinations of 44 consecutive 
      pediatric patients (26 girls, mean age 11±6 years) including standard sequences 
      and DWI (b=50/800 s/mm(2)) at 1.5 or 3 Tesla were retrospectively evaluated. The 
      study group contained 10 patients with non-treated malignant tumors and 34 
      patients with benign lesions. Size, relative signal intensity and apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC, unit ×10(-3) mm(2)/s) were determined in one lesion 
      per patient. RESULTS: Mean ADC was 0.78±0.45×10(-3) mm(2)/s in patients with 
      malignant tumors and 1.71±0.75 ×10(-3) mm(2)/s in patients with benign lesions 
      (P<0.001). Relative operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed a sensitivity 
      of 90% and a specificity of 91% for malignancy, based on an ADC cut-off value of 
      ≤1.03. On logistic regression, mean ADC and lesion size accounted for 62% of 
      variability in benign vs. malignant tumors. For malignant tumors, the signal 
      intensity ratio was higher on DWI than on T1w post-contrast images (P<0.002). Two 
      cases of local tumor recurrence were diagnosed by DWI only. CONCLUSIONS: DWI 
      shows promising results for determination of biological dignity in 
      musculoskeletal tumors. Mean ADC ≤1.03×10(-3) mm(2)/s is a strong indicator of 
      malignancy at the first diagnosis. The use of DWI for early diagnosis of tumor 
      recurrence in comparison with standard MRI sequences should be evaluated in 
      prospective studies.

PG  - e4385
LID - 10.1002/nbm.4385 [doi]

AB  - Quantitative MRI and MRS of muscle are increasingly being used to measure 
      individual pathophysiological processes in Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). In 
      particular, muscle fat fraction was shown to be highly associated with functional 
      tests in BMD. However, the muscle strength per unit of contractile 
      cross-sectional area is lower in patients with BMD compared with healthy 
      controls. This suggests that the quality of the non-fat-replaced (NFR) muscle 
      tissue is lower than in healthy controls. Consequently, a measure that reflects 
      changes in muscle tissue itself is needed. Here, we explore the potential of 
      water T(2) relaxation times, diffusion parameters and phosphorus metabolic 
      indices as early disease markers in patients with BMD. For this purpose, we 
      examined these measures in fat-replaced (FR) and NFR lower leg muscles in 
      patients with BMD and compared these values with those in healthy controls. 
      Quantitative proton MRI (three-point Dixon, multi-spin-echo and 
      diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo planar imaging) and 2D chemical shift imaging 
      (31) P MRS data were acquired in 24 patients with BMD (age 18.8-66.2 years) and 
      13 healthy controls (age 21.3-63.6 years). Muscle fat fractions, phosphorus 
      metabolic indices, and averages and standard deviations (SDs) of the water T(2) 
      relaxation times and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters were assessed in 
      six individual leg muscles. Phosphodiester levels were increased in the NFR and 
      FR tibialis anterior, FR peroneus and FR gastrocnemius lateralis muscles. No 
      clear pattern was visible for the other metabolic indices. Increased T(2) SD was 
      found in the majority of FR muscles compared with NFR and healthy control 
      muscles. No differences in average water T(2) relaxation times or DTI indices 
      were found between groups. Overall, our results indicate that primarily muscles 
      that are further along in the disease process showed increases in T(2) 
      heterogeneity and changes in some metabolic indices. No clear differences were 
      found for the DTI indices between groups.

TI  - Interrelations of muscle functional MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI and (31) P-MRS in 
      exercised lower back muscles.
PG  - 958-70

AB  - Exercise-induced changes of transverse proton relaxation time (T2 ), tissue 
      perfusion and metabolic turnover were investigated in the lower back muscles of 
      volunteers by applying muscle functional MRI (mfMRI) and diffusion-weighted 
      imaging (DWI) before and after as well as dynamic (31) P-MRS during the exercise. 
      Inner (M. multifidus, MF) and outer lower back muscles (M. erector spinae, ES) 
      were examined in 14 healthy young men performing a sustained isometric 
      trunk-extension. Significant phosphocreatine (PCr) depletions ranging from 30% 
      (ES) to 34% (MF) and Pi accumulations between 95% (left ES) and 120%-140% (MF 
      muscles and right ES) were observed during the exercise, which were accompanied 
      by significantly decreased pH values in all muscles (∆pH ≈ -0.05). Baseline T2 
      values were similar across all investigated muscles (approximately 27 ms at 3 T), 
      but revealed right-left asymmetric increases (T2 ,inc ) after the exercise (right 
      ES/MF: T2 ,inc  = 11.8/9.7%; left ES/MF: T2 ,inc  = 4.6/8.9%). Analyzed muscles 
      also showed load-induced increases in molecular diffusion D (p = .007) and 
      perfusion fraction f (p = .002). The latter parameter was significantly higher in 
      the MF than in the ES muscles both at rest and post exercise. Changes in PCr 
      (p = .03), diffusion (p < .01) and perfusion (p = .03) were strongly associated 
      with T2,inc , and linear mixed model analysis revealed that changes in PCr and 
      perfusion both affect T2,inc (p < .001). These findings support previous 
      assumptions that T2 changes are not only an intra-cellular phenomenon resulting 
      from metabolic stress but are also affected by increased perfusion in loaded 
      muscles.

TI  - The Relationship Between Quadriceps Femoris Muscle Function and MRI-Derived Water 
      Diffusion and Adipose Tissue Measurements in Young Healthy Males.
LID - 10.1002/jmri.28525 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Water diffusion and adipose tissue in a muscle can be evaluated by 
      MRI. However, determining which quadriceps femoris muscle (QM) characteristics 
      independently predict peak knee extension torque during maximum voluntary 
      isometric contractions (MVICs), individual muscle activity during MVICs and 
      sit-to-stand transitions is unknown. PURPOSE: To determine which QM 
      characteristics predict knee extension muscle strength and individual muscle 
      activity. STUDY TYPE: Prospective, cross-sectional. SUBJECTS: A total of 20 
      healthy males (aged 22-40 years) with a physical activity level <1 hour/week. 
      FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5-T, diffusion-weighted fast spin-echo echo-planar 
      imaging and T1-weighted fast spin-echo sequences. ASSESSMENT: The vastus medialis 
      (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), and vastus intermedius were 
      segmented in a single axial diffusion-weighted image and T1-weighted image at the 
      right mid-thigh region. λ(1-3) and fractional anisotropy (FA), and the percentage 
      of intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) were measured. The knee extension peak 
      force during MVICs was measured by a dynamometer, and the torque was calculated 
      at the peak force × length. The ratios of the individual muscle activity to the 
      total muscle (VM, VL, and RF) during MVICs and sit-to-stand transitions were 
      assessed using surface electromyography. STATISTICAL TESTS: Regression analysis 
      was conducted to identify the predictors of peak knee extension torque and of 
      individual muscle activity ratios. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically 
      significant. RESULTS: The RF λ(1) significantly predicted the peak knee extension 
      torque (β = -0.51). The IMAT percentage of the VM significantly predicted the VM 
      muscle activity ratio during the MVIC and sit-to-stand transition (β = -0.82 and 
      β = -0.61, respectively), whereas the ratio of the VM λ(1) to the whole QM λ(1) 
      significantly predicted the VM muscle activity ratio during the sit-to-stand 
      transitions (β = 0.35 and β = 0.46, respectively). DATA CONCLUSION: The RF λ(1) 
      may allow to estimate peak knee extension muscle torque, and the VM IMAT and λ(1) 
      may predict muscle activity in youth. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 3. TECHNICAL EFFICACY: 
      Stage 3.

TI  - Comparison of fetal lung maturation in fetuses with intrauterine growth 
      restriction with control group, using lung volume, lung/liver and lung/muscle 
      signal intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient ratios on different magnetic 
      resonance imaging sequences.
PG  - 8936-8944
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2021.2008349 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare lung volume, lung apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and 
      signal intensity ratio (SIR) on different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      sequences between intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) fetuses and the control 
      group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 49 IUGR and 58 non-IUGR fetuses were imaged using 3 
      Tesla MRI units. Total lung volume (TLV), lung/liver SIR (LLSIR) and lung/muscle 
      SIR (LMSIR) in T1 and T2-weighted sequences and lung/liver ADC ratio (LLADCR) and 
      lung/muscle ADC ratio (LMADCR) were assessed. RESULTS: LLSIR and LMSIR were 
      significantly higher in the T1-weighted sequence (p-value: .03) and LLADCR and 
      LMADCR were significantly lower on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in IUGR 
      fetuses compared to the control group (p-value: .01). There was no significant 
      difference in SIRs in the T2-weighted sequence between the two groups. Although 
      TLV was increased with gestational age in both groups, it was significantly lower 
      in the IUGR group (mean: 82 ± 22.7 ml vs. 110.8 ± 18 ml, p-value: <.001). 
      CONCLUSION: The T1-weighted sequence and DWI seem to be better than the 
      T2-weighted sequence for assessing the faint difference of lung maturity between 
      groups. However, SIR differences were not as meaningful as TLV differences and 
      this could be related to the complex maturation process in IUGR fetuses as the 
      effect of higher endogenous corticosteroids.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a model-based reconstruction technique for diffusion 
      quantification based on accelerated two-dimensional echo planar data, obtained 
      with multiple b-weightings. In combination with a dedicated undersampling 
      pattern, acceleration factors above three were proven feasible in a clinical 
      setting. METHODS: The proposed model-based method minimizes a cost function 
      considering the l(2)-norm of the difference between the Fourier transformation of 
      a synthetic diffusion-model-generated k-space and the measured k-space data. 
      Further regularization is performed by introduction of a total variation (TV) 
      constraint to the cost function. Acceleration is achieved by a non-random 
      undersampling pattern using acceleration factors that correspond to the total 
      number of b-values. A rectangular region of variable size, centered in k-space, 
      remains fully sampled for correction of phase variations, introduced by the 
      different diffusion-encoding strengths. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of the 
      resulting images (S(0) and ADC) demonstrates the potential of the suggested 
      undersampling pattern in combination with a model-based iterative reconstruction. 
      An edge analysis highlights the preservation of high-frequency information for 
      all investigated undersampling factors. In comparison to a conventional 
      SENSE-accelerated reconstruction, the quantitative analysis of the ADC maps 
      revealed a significantly (P<0.05) superior performance of the suggested 
      technique, enabling acceleration factors of R=3.65 without compromising diffusion 
      data fidelity. CONCLUSION: The presented work shows the potential of model-based 
      ADC quantification, which, in combination with a suited undersampling pattern for 
      multiple b-values, enables more than three-fold acceleration using 
      two-dimensional EPI without sacrificing ADC fidelity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Limited visibility of post-resection muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
      (MIBC) on CT hinders radiotherapy dose escalation of the residual tumour. 
      Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) visualises areas of high tumour burden and is 
      increasingly used within diagnosis and as a biomarker for cancer. DW-MRI could, 
      therefore, facilitate dose escalation, potentially via dose-painting and/or 
      accommodating response. However, the distortion inherent in DW-MRI could limit 
      geometric accuracy. Therefore, this study aims to quantify DW-MRI distortion via 
      imaging of a bladder phantom. METHODS: A phantom was designed to mimic MIBC and 
      imaged using CT, DW-MRI and T2W-MRI. Fiducial marker locations were compared 
      across modalities and publicly available software was assessed for correction of 
      magnetic susceptibility-related distortion. RESULTS: Fiducial marker locations on 
      CT and T2W-MRI agreed within 1.2 mm at 3 T and 1.8 mm at 1.5 T. The greatest 
      discrepancy between CT and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps was 6.3 mm 
      at 3 T, reducing to 1.8 mm when corrected for distortion. At 1.5 T, these values 
      were 3.9 mm and 1.7 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Geometric distortion in DW-MRI 
      of a model bladder was initially >6 mm at 3 T and >3 mm at 1.5 T; however, 
      established correction methods reduced this to <2 mm in both cases. ADVANCES IN 
      KNOWLEDGE: A phantom designed to mimic MIBC has been produced and used to show 
      distortion in DW-MRI can be sufficiently mitigated for incorporation into the 
      radiotherapy pathway. Further investigation is therefore warranted to enable 
      individually adaptive image-guided radiotherapy of MIBC based upon DW-MRI.

TI  - Evaluation of extraocular muscles in patients with thyroid associated 
      ophthalmopathy using apparent diffusion coefficient measured by magnetic

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is an autoimmune orbital 
      disease characterized by edema of extraocular muscles (EOMs). PURPOSE: To 
      characterize the inflammation of EOMs in patients with TAO before and after 
      radiation therapy using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and to analyze the 
      correlation between ADC and clinical activity of TAO. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 
      ADCs of superior rectus (SR), inferior rectus (IR), medial rectus (MR), and 
      lateral rectus (LR) muscles were measured in 52 eyes of 26 patients with TAO 
      before and three months after orbital radiation therapy. In addition, 38 eyes of 
      20 healthy volunteers were included. The clinical activity score (CAS) was 
      evaluated. The ADC maps were reconstructed and measured on the coronal 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence and calculated in mm(2)/s. RESULTS: The 
      mean ADCs of EOMs before treatment were 1.42 ± 0.23 in SR, 1.37 ± 0.23 in IR, 
      1.41 ± 0.21 in MR, and 1.28 ± 0.25 in LR. The mean ADCs after treatment were 
      1.27 ± 0.18, 1.22 ± 0.26, 1.30 ± 0.22, and 1.15 ± 0.21, respectively. The ADCs 
      were significantly decreased after treatment (all P < 0.001). The ADCs of 
      patients with TAO were significantly higher than those of controls. There was a 
      statistically significant correlation between the mean ADCs and the CAS in each 
      patient with TAO both before and after treatment (before: r = 0.520; P < 0.001; 
      after: r = 0.625; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The ADC values of EOMs can be exploited 
      as a quantitative indicator to evaluate the clinical activity and monitor the 
      therapeutic responses of patients with TAO.

TI  - IVIM Imaging of Paraspinal Muscles Following Moderate and High-Intensity Exercise 
      in Healthy Individuals.
LID - 910068 [pii]
LID - 10.3389/fresc.2022.910068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantification of the magnitude and spatial distribution of muscle 
      blood flow changes following exercise may improve our understanding of the 
      effectiveness of various exercise prescriptions. Intravoxel incoherent motion 
      (IVIM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique that quantifies molecular 
      diffusion and microvascular blood flow, and has recently gained momentum as a 
      method to evaluate a muscle's response to exercise. It has also been shown to 
      predict responses to exercise-based physical therapy in individuals with low back 
      pain. However, no study has evaluated the sensitivity of IVIM-MRI to exercise of 
      varying intensity in humans. Here, we aimed to evaluate IVIM signal changes of 
      the paraspinal muscles in response to moderate and high intensity lumbar 
      extension exercise in healthy individuals. METHODS: IVIM data were collected in 
      11 healthy volunteers before and immediately after a 3-min bout of moderate and 
      high-intensity resisted lumbar extension. IVIM data were analyzed to determine 
      the average perfusion fraction (f), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*), and 
      diffusion coefficient (D) in the bilateral paraspinal muscles. Changes in IVIM 
      parameters were compared between the moderate and high intensity exercise bouts. 
      RESULTS: Exercise increased all IVIM parameters, regardless of intensity (p < 
      0.003). Moderate intensity exercise resulted in a 11.2, 19.6, and 3.5% increase 
      in f, D* and D, respectively. High intensity exercise led to a similar increase 
      in f (12.2%), but much greater changes in D* (48.6%) and D (7.9%). CONCLUSION: 
      IVIM parameter increases suggest that both the moderate and high-intensity 
      exercise conditions elicited measurable changes in blood flow (increased f and 
      D*) and extravascular molecular diffusion rates (increased D), and that there was 
      a dose-dependence of exercise intensity on D* and D.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To confirm the feasibility and compare the accuracy of 
      magnetic resonance imaging intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and T2 mapping 
      models for the differentiation of autoimmune myositis from muscular dystrophy. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourty-two autoimmune myositis and 11 muscular dystrophy 
      patients proven by diagnostic criteria were enrolled in the study. Conventional 
      MR sequences, IVIM, and T2 mapping through the bilateral thighs were obtained as 
      well as blood samples for all patients. IVIM and T2 mapping parameters as well as 
      serum markers were compared between the autoimmune myositis and muscular 
      dystrophy groups. Mann-Whitney U tests were performed for statistical analysis 
      along with receiver operating characteristic curves. Spearman correlation 
      coefficient models were constructed to analyze the correlation between IVIM and 
      T2 mapping with serological parameters. RESULTS: The intramuscular apparent 
      diffusion coefficient, tissue diffusivity (D), perfusion fraction (f(p)), and T2 
      relaxation time values were statistically significantly different between the 
      autoimmune myositis and muscular dystrophy groups (p < 0.05). Pseudo diffusivity 
      (D(p)) values showed no statistical difference between the groups (p > 0.05). D 
      parameter of IVIM sequences differentiated autoimmune and muscular dystrophy with 
      a higher specificity of 75.60%. T2 values within the thighs were correlated with 
      serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      Thigh muscle IVIM and T2 mapping parameters are useful in differentiating 
      autoimmune myositis from muscular dystrophy, particularly the IVIM parameters.

TI  - Muscle-invasive bladder cancer: pretreatment prediction of response to 
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy with diffusion-weighted MR imaging.
PG  - 2148-2157
LID - 10.1007/s00261-022-03455-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the usefulness of diffusion-weighted MR imaging with ADC 
      value and histogram analysis of ADC in the prediction of response to neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). 
      METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients with clinical T2-4aN0M0 MIBC who 
      underwent MRI before and after NAC were enrolled in the prospective study. The 
      evaluation of response to NAC was based on the pathologic T (pT) stage after 
      surgery. Patients with non-muscle-invasive residual cancer (pTa, pTis, pT1) were 
      defined as responders, while those with muscle-invasive residual cancer (≥ pT2) 
      were defined as non-responders. The ADC value measured from a single-section 
      region of interest and ADC histogram parameters derived from whole-tumor volume 
      of interest in responder and non-responder were compared using the Mann-Whitney U 
      test or independent samples t test. ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate the 
      diagnostic performance of ADC value and ADC histogram parameters in predicting 
      the response to NAC. RESULTS: The pretreatment ADC value of responders ([1.33 
      (± 0.21)] × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) was significantly higher than that of non-responders 
      ([1.09 (± 0.08)] × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) (P < .001). Most of the pretreatment ADC 
      histogram parameters (Mean, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles) of 
      responders were significantly higher than that of non-responders (P < .001). The 
      AUC was highest for the pretreatment ADC value (0.88; 95% confidence interval: 
      0.77, 0.95; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging with ADC value 
      and histogram analysis of ADC are useful to predict NAC response in patients with 
      MIBC.

TI  - Combining volumetric apparent diffusion coefficient histogram analysis with 
      vesical imaging reporting and data system to predict the muscle invasion of 
      bladder cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore whether volumetric apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram analysis can provide additional value to 
      Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) in differentiating 
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) from non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
      (NMIBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 80 patients were retrospectively reviewed with 
      pathologically proven NMIBC (n = 53) or MIBC (n = 27). All patients underwent MRI 
      including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (b = 0, 800 s/mm(2)), and the VI-RADS 
      score was evaluated based on DWI. Volumetric ADC histogram parameters were 
      calculated from the volumetric of interest (VOI) on DWI, including the min ADC, 
      mean ADC, median ADC, max ADC, 10th, 25th, 75th, 90th percentiles ADC, skewness, 
      kurtosis, and entropy. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare histogram 
      parameters between NMIBC and MIBC. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was 
      used to evaluate the diagnostic value of each significant parameter. RESULTS: 
      Among all parameters, the VI-RADS yield the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC, 
      0.88; sensitivity, 88.89%; specificity, 83.61%). MIBC had significantly lower min 
      ADC, mean ADC, median ADC, 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles ADC than NMIBC 
      (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.003, p = 0.004, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). 
      Skewness and kurtosis of MIBC were significantly higher than those of NMIBC 
      (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). The combination of VI-RADS and skewness showed 
      significantly higher AUC (AUC 0.923; 95% CI 0.847-0.969) than only with VI-RADS 
      (AUC 0.880; 95% CI 0.793-0.940). CONCLUSION: Volumetric ADC histogram analysis 
      and VI-RADS are both useful methods in differentiating MIBC from NMIBC, and the 
      volumetric ADC histogram analysis can provide additional value to VI-RADS.

TI  - Disrupted structural connectome and neurocognitive functions in Duchenne muscular 
      dystrophy: classifying and subtyping based on Dp140 dystrophin isoform.
PG  - 2113-2125
LID - 10.1007/s00415-021-10789-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neurocognitive disabilities in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) 
      children beginning in early childhood and distal DMD gene deletions involving 
      disruption of Dp140 isoform are more likely to manifest significant 
      neurocognitive impairments. MRI data analysis techniques like brain-network 
      metrics can provide information on microstructural integrity and underlying 
      pathophysiology. METHODS: A prospective study on 95 participants [DMD = 57, and 
      healthy controls (HC) = 38]. The muscular dystrophy functional rating scale 
      (MDFRS) scores, neuropsychology batteries, and multiplex ligand-dependent probe 
      amplification (MLPA) testing were used for clinical assessment, IQ estimation, 
      and genotypic classification. Diffusion MRI and network-based statistics were 
      used to analyze structural connectomes at various levels and correlate with 
      clinical markers. RESULTS: Motor and executive sub-networks were extracted and 
      analyzed. Out of 57 DMD children, 23 belong to Dp140 + and 34 to Dp140- subgroup. 
      Motor disabilities are pronounced in Dp140- subgroup as reflected by lower MDFRS 
      scores. IQ parameters are significantly low in all-DMD cases; however, the Dp140- 
      has specifically lowest scores. Significant differences were observed in global 
      efficiency, transitivity, and characteristic path length between HC and DMD. 
      Subgroup analysis demonstrates that the significance is mainly driven by 
      participants with Dp140- than Dp140 + isoform. Finally, a random forest 
      classifier model illustrated an accuracy of 79% between HC and DMD and 90% 
      between DMD- subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings demonstrate structural 
      network-based characterization of abnormalities in DMD, especially prominent in 
      Dp140-. Our observations suggest that participants with Dp140 + have relatively 
      intact connectivity while Dp140- show widespread connectivity alterations at 
      global, nodal, and edge levels. This study provides valuable insights supporting 
      the genotype-phenotype correlation of brain-behavior involvement in DMD children.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the time-course of the physical properties of the 
      psoas major muscle (PM) before and after exercise using magnetic resonance 
      elastography (MRE). Muscle stiffness is one of the important properties 
      associated with muscle function. However, there was no research on the stiffness 
      of the PM after exercise. In this study, we investigated time-course changes of 
      the shear modulus of the PM after exercise. Furthermore, T2 values and apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC), as the additional information associated with 
      muscular physical properties, were also measured simultaneously. Healthy young 
      male volunteers were recruited in this study (n = 9) and they were required to 
      perform a hand-to-knee isometric and unilateral exercise (left side). At each 
      time-point before and after exercise, a set of 3 types of MR scans to measure 
      multiple physical properties of the PM [shear modulus (MRE), T2 values, and ADC] 
      were repeatedly taken. On day 1, a single set MR scan was taken before exercise 
      (pre-exercise MR scan), and 6 sets MR scans were taken (5.5 to 38.0 min after 
      exercise). After about 10-min rest (46.0 to 56.0 min after exercise), 4 sets MR 
      scans were taken (57.5 to 77.0 min after exercise). About 10-min rest was taken 
      again (85.0-95.0 min after exercise), 4 sets MR scans were taken (96.5 to 
      116.0 min after exercise). On days 2 and 7, a single set MR scan (MRE, T2 value, 
      and ADC) was taken on each experimental day. The data were analyzed as relative 
      changes (%) of the given parameters to the pre-exercise values. The results 
      indicated significant decreases in PM shear modulus up to about 30 min after 
      exercise. Then, it gradually increased and showed significant increases at about 
      100 min after exercise compared to that before exercise. T2 values and ADC showed 
      significant increases up to about 65 min after exercise compared to those before 
      exercise, and then returned to the pre-exercise values. On days 2 and 7, all 
      values showed no significant changes compared to the pre-exercise values. This 
      study is the first to report the time-course of the physical properties of the PM 
      after exercise.

AB  - AIM: To identify the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of metastases to 
      the extraocular muscles (EOM metastases). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The MRI features 
      of 19 patients with EOM metastases were compared with those of 24 patients with 
      EOM diseases of non-thyroid origin. MRI was used to assess the number of tumours, 
      morphology, signal intensity on T2-weighted images, enhancement patterns, and 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. RESULTS: Single muscular involvement 
      was observed in 10 patients, and multiple muscular involvement was observed in 
      nine patients. The morphology was focally discrete in nine patients, and diffuse 
      infiltrative in 10 patients; all the nine patients with focal discrete morphology 
      presented with single muscular lesions. On T2-weighted images, the signal 
      intensities were intermediate or low in 15 patients and a mixture of high and 
      intermediate in four patients. In 14 patients for whom contrast-enhanced images 
      were available, ring enhancement (n=5), heterogeneous diffuse enhancement (n=5), 
      and homogeneous enhancement (n=4) were seen. The mean ADC value was 0.98 × 10(-3) 
      mm(2)/s. Compared to other EOM diseases of non-thyroid origin, single muscular 
      presentation, focal discrete morphology, the presence of hyperintensity on 
      T2-weighted images, and ring or heterogeneous enhancement were significantly more 
      frequent in EOM metastases. CONCLUSION: The MRI features of EOM metastases showed 
      two main patterns: a single discrete mass and multiple infiltrative masses. In 
      addition to the presentation as a single discrete mass, the presence of 
      hyperintensity on T2-weighted images and ring or heterogeneous enhancement can 
      aid in the differentiation of EOM metastases from other EOM diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides added value to conventional 
      MRI imaging in diagnosing and differentiating various benign and malignant 
      musculoskeletal tumors. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the diagnostic 
      efficacies of diffusion-weighted imaging along with the conventional MRI 
      sequences for differentiating benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors using 
      sensitivity and specificity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was 
      carried out on 73 histopathologically proven patients of various musculoskeletal 
      tumors who presented to a tertiary care center between March 2017 to October 
      2018. Relevant clinical examinations and MRI scan of the requested body part of 
      the musculoskeletal system were performed. Mean apparent diffusion coefficient 
      (ADC) values were calculated in the bone as well as soft tissue tumors after 
      placing uniform-sized region of interest (ROI) in the non-necrotic portion of the 
      tumor. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance 
      (ANOVA) test were used to compare the mean ADC values of the various tumors with 
      the histopathology. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was 
      done to determine the cut-off mean ADC values in the various bone and soft tissue 
      tumors. RESULTS: Of 73 patients with musculoskeletal tumors (benign=20, malignant 
      = 53), 47 patients were bone tumors (benign=12, malignant=35) and 26 patients 
      were soft tissue tumors (benign=eight, malignant=18). Mean ADC value of benign 
      bone tumor was 1.257±0.327[SD] x 10(-3)mm2/s and malignant was 0.951 ± 0.177[SD] 
      x 10(-3)mm2/s. The mean ADC value of benign soft tissue tumor was 1.603±0.444[SD] 
      x 10(-3)mm2/s and malignant was 1.036 ± 0.186[SD] x 10(-3)mm2/s. The cut-off mean 
      ADC value was 1.058 x 10(-3)mm2/s for differentiating benign from malignant bone 
      tumor with a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 66.7% and accuracy of 78.7% 
      while the cut-off mean ADC value of 1.198 x 10(-3)mm2/s for differentiating 
      benign from malignant soft tissue tumors with a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity 
      of 87.5% and accuracy of 84.6%. CONCLUSIONS: DWI with ADC mapping can be used as 
      an additional reliable tool along with conventional MRI sequences in 
      discriminating benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted MR imaging and utility of ADC measurements in characterizing 
      nerve and muscle changes in diabetic patients on ankle DWI studies: a 
      cross-sectional study.
LID - 10.1007/s00330-023-09466-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 
      measurements from ankle MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) studies in 
      identifying neuropathic changes in diabetic patients. METHODS: In total, 109 
      consecutive ankle MRI scans (n = 101 patients) at a single tertiary care county 
      hospital from November 1, 2019, to July 11, 2021, who met the inclusion criteria 
      were identified. Patients were divided into 2 cohorts: diabetic (n = 62) and 
      non-diabetic (n = 39). Demographics, HgbA1c, neuropathy diagnosis, and image 
      quality data were collected. Abductor hallucis (AH) ADC mean and minimum (min) 
      values and posterior tibial nerve (PTN) ADC mean and minimum values were 
      measured. Student t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis were 
      performed using R. RESULTS: Diabetic patients had significantly higher mean and 
      min ADC values (× 10(-3) mm(2)/s) of the AH muscle (mean: 1.77 vs 1.39, 
      p < 0.001; min: 1.51 vs 1.06, p < 0.001) and PTN (mean: 1.65 vs 1.18, p < 0.001; 
      min: 1.33 vs 0.95, p < 0.001) compared to non-diabetic patients. HgbA1c 
      positively correlated with AH and PTN ADC mean values (AH: p = 0.036; PTN: 
      p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that an increasing diffusivity of water 
      as quantified by ADC across neuronal and muscular membranes is a consequence of 
      the pathophysiology of the disease. Thus, ankle MRI-DWI studies are useful in 
      identifying neuropathic changes in diabetic patients and quantifying the severity 
      noninvasively. KEY POINTS: • Diabetic patients had significantly higher mean and 
      minimum ADC values of the abductor hallucis muscle and posterior tibial nerve 
      compared to non-diabetic patients. • HgbA1c positively correlated with ADC mean 
      values (AH: p = 0.036; PTN: p = 0.004) suggesting that an increasing diffusivity 
      of water across neuronal and muscular membranes is a consequence of the 
      pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy. • Ankle MRI DWI can be used clinically to 
      non-invasively identify neuropathic changes due to diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Diagnostic Performance of Diffusion MRI for differentiating Benign and Malignant 
      Nonfatty Musculoskeletal Soft Tissue Tumors: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis.
PG  - 7399-7412
LID - 10.7150/jca.62131 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of standard diffusion-weighted 
      imaging (DWI), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and diffusion kurtosis 
      imaging (DKI), for differentiating benign and malignant soft tissue tumors 
      (STTs). Materials and methods: A thorough search was carried out to identify 
      suitable studies published up to September 2020. The quality of the studies 
      involved was evaluated using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 
      (QUADAS-2). The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and summary receiver 
      operating characteristic (SROC) curve were calculated using bivariate mixed 
      effects models. A subgroup analysis was also performed to explore the 
      heterogeneity. Results: Eighteen studies investigating 1319 patients with 
      musculoskeletal STTs (malignant, n=623; benign, n=696) were enrolled. Thirteen 
      standard DWI studies using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) showed that 
      the pooled SEN and SPE of ADC were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.77-0.82) and 0.63 (95% CI: 
      0.60-0.67), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) calculated from the SROC 
      curve was 0.806. The subgroup analysis indicated that the percentage of myxoid 
      malignant tumors, magnet strength, study design, and ROI placement were 
      significant factors affecting heterogeneity. Four IVIM studies showed that the 
      AUCs calculated from the SROC curves of the parameters ADC and D were 0.859 and 
      0.874, respectively. The AUCs for the IVIM parameters pseudo diffusion 
      coefficient (D*) and perfusion fraction (f) calculated from the SROC curve were 
      0.736 and 0.573, respectively. Two DKI studies showed that the AUCs of the DKI 
      parameter mean kurtosis (MK) were 0.97 and 0.89, respectively. Conclusion: The 
      DWI-derived ADC value and the IVIM DWI-derived D value might be accurate tools 
      for discriminating musculoskeletal STTs, especially for non-myxoid SSTs, using 
      more than two b values, with maximal b value ranging from 600 to 800 s/mm(2), 
      additionally, a high-field strength (3.0 T) optimizes the diagnostic performance.

TI  - MRI of Skeletal Muscles in Participants with Type 2 Diabetes with or without 
      Diabetic Polyneuropathy.
PG  - 608-619
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2020192647 [doi]
AB  - BackgroundDiabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is associated with loss of muscle 
      strength. MRI including diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) may enable detection of 
      muscle abnormalities related to type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and DPN.PurposeTo 
      assess skeletal muscle abnormalities in participants with DM2 with or without DPN 
      by using MRI.Materials and MethodsThis prospective cross-sectional study included 
      participants with DM2 and DPN (DPN positive), participants with DM2 without DPN 
      (DPN negative), and healthy control (HC) participants enrolled between August 
      2017 and June 2018. Muscle strength at the knee and ankle was determined with 
      isokinetic dynamometry. MRI of the lower extremities included the Dixon sequence, 
      multicomponent T2 mapping, and DTI calculated fat fractions (FFs), T2 relaxation 
      of muscle (T2(water)), fractional anisotropy (FA), and diffusivity (mean, axial, 
      and radial). One-way analysis of variance and Tukey honestly significant 
      difference were applied for comparison between groups, and multivariate 
      regression models were used for association between MRI parameters, nerve 
      conduction, strength, and body mass index (BMI).ResultsTwenty participants with 
      DPN (mean age, 65 years ± 9 [standard deviation]; 70% men; mean BMI, 34 kg/m(2) ± 
      5), 20 participants without DPN (mean age, 64 years ± 9; 55% men; mean BMI, 30 
      kg/m(2) ± 6), and 20 HC participants (mean age, 61 years ± 10; 55% men; mean BMI, 
      27 kg/m(2) ± 5) were enrolled in this study. Muscle strength adjusted for age, 
      sex, and BMI was lower in participants with DPN than in DPN-negative and HC 
      participants in the upper and lower leg (plantar flexors [PF], 62% vs 78% vs 89%; 
      P < .001; knee extensors [KE], 73% vs 95% vs 93%; P < .001). FF was higher in leg 
      muscle groups of participants with DPN than in DPN-negative and HC participants 
      (PF, 20% vs 10% vs 8%; P < .001; KE, 13% vs 8% vs 6%; P < .001). T2(water) was 
      prolonged in leg muscle groups of participants with DPN when compared with HC 
      participants (PF, 33 msec vs 31 msec; P < .001; KE, 32 msec vs 31 msec; P = .002) 
      and in the lower leg when compared with participants without DPN (PF, 33 msec vs 
      32 msec; P = .03). In multivariate regression models, strength was associated 
      with FA (b = -0.0004), T2(water) (b = -0.03 msec), and FF (b = -0.1%) at thigh 
      level (P < .001). Furthermore, FA (b = -0.007), T2(water) (b = -0.53 msec), and 
      FF (b = -4.0%) were associated with nerve conduction at calf level (P < 
      .001).ConclusionMRI of leg muscle groups revealed fat accumulation, differences 
      in water composition, and structural changes in participants with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus and neuropathy. Abnormalities were most pronounced in the plantar 
      flexors.© RSNA, 2020Online supplemental material is available for this

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the correlation of maximum standardized uptake values 
      (SUV(max)) of (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed 
      tomography (FDG-PET/CT) with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of 
      diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in musculoskeletal malignancies. METHODS: 
      Institutional ethics committee approved this retrospective study. Twenty-seven 
      patients (mean age: 44.85 ± 24.07; 17 men and 10 women) with a total of 29 
      musculoskeletal tumors underwent both FDG-PET/CT and DWI between January 2017 and 
      March 2020. Region-of-interest (ROI)-based maximal standardized uptake values 
      (SUV(max)) of the tumors were measured on FDG-PET/CT images. Two radiologists 
      measured lesions' mean and minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(mean) and 
      ADC(min)) using five distinct ROIs on DWI images. Pearson correlation analysis 
      was used to assess the correlation between SUV(max) and ADC values. RESULTS: 
      There were 18 soft tissue tumors (62.1%) and 11 bone tumors (37.9%) with a mean 
      maximum diameter of 9.4 ± 6.2 cm. The mean SUV(max), ADC(mean) and ADC(min) of 
      the whole lesions were 12.93 ± 9.63, 0.85 ± 0.28 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s and 0.61 ± 0.27 
      × 10(-3)mm(2)/s, respectively. SUV(max) had a weak correlation with tumor maximum 
      diameter (r = 0.378, p = 0.043), whereas ADC(mean) and ADC(min) had none. There 
      was strong inverse correlation between SUV(max) and both ADC(mean) (r = -0.616, p 
      < 0.001) and ADC(min) (r = -0.638, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In musculoskeletal 
      tumors, quantitative markers of FDG uptake and diffusion restriction strongly 
      correlate.

TI  - Multiparametric MR Imaging of Age-related Changes in Healthy Thigh Muscles.
PG  - 235-246
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2017171316 [doi]
AB  - Purpose To use multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to assess for and 
      establish age-related differences in healthy thigh muscles. Materials and Methods 
      Ninety-five subjects (47 men, 48 women; median age, 47 years) with healthy body 
      mass index were grouped according to age: 30-39 years (n = 25), 40-49 years (n = 
      25), 50-59 years (n = 25), and 60-69 years (n = 20). Multiparametric MR imaging 
      (intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted, diffusion-tensor, multiecho 
      Dixon, and dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging) was performed at 3.0 T. 
      Two radiologists independently evaluated parametric maps of the anterior, medial, 
      and posterior compartments. Welch-modified one-way analysis of variance and post 
      hoc Dunnet T3 test were used to evaluate differences in apparent diffusion, true 
      diffusion, and pseudodiffusion coefficients; perfusion fraction; fractional 
      anisotropy (FA); fat percentage; volume transfer constant; constant efflux rate 
      from the extravascular-extracellular space to plasma; volume fraction of the 
      extravascular-extracellular space (V(e)); incremental area under the curve; and 
      Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were used to evaluate relationship 
      strength. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify independent 
      predictors of age, and interrater reliability was assessed with intraclass 
      correlation coefficients. Results There were significant differences among the 
      age groups in apparent diffusion coefficients (P = .010), true diffusion 
      coefficients (P = .045), FA (P < .001), V(e) (P = .029) of the anterior 
      compartment muscles, and fat percentages of all three compartments (P ≤ .001). 
      Moreover, FA (Pearson r = 0.428, Spearman ρ = 0.431; P < .001) and V(e) (r = 
      0.226, P = .030 and ρ = 0.309, P = .003) in the anterior compartment and fat 
      percentages in all three compartments (r = 0.481, 0.475, and 0.573; ρ = 0.515, 
      0.487, and 0.667; respectively; P < .001) were positively associated with age. 
      Multiple regression analysis showed that age was predictive of fat percentage in 
      the posterior compartment (β = 0.500, P < .001) and of FA in the anterior 
      compartment (β = 0.194, P = .042). Interrater reliability was excellent 
      (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.745-0.992). Conclusion Multiple MR imaging 
      parameters were significantly associated with age in thigh muscles. (©) RSNA,

TI  - Diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced dynamic and diffusion-weighted MR 
      imaging in the assessment of tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy in 
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
PG  - 2712-2721
LID - 10.1007/s00261-021-02963-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of DCE MRI and DWI in the 
      assessment of pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
      (NAC) in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). METHODS: This 
      prospective study included 90 patients with MIBC who finished NAC. Two 
      radiologists independently assessed MRI for the determination of 
      semi-quantitative parameters (wash-in rate and wash-out rate) and apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) value. The correlation between pCR and wash-in rate, 
      wash-out rate, ADC value were analyzed. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 
      used to evaluate the diagnostic performance for detecting pCR. Inter-reader 
      agreement was assessed using the ICC statistics. RESULTS: On cystectomy 
      specimens, pCR was confirmed in (43.3%, 39/90). pCR is negatively correlated with 
      wash-out rate (r = - 0.701, p = 0.01) and ADC value (r = - 0.621, p = 0.01). ADC 
      value is positively correlated with wash-out rate (r = 0.631, p = 0.001). The 
      diagnostic accuracy of ADC value (cut-off value: 0.911 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) and 
      wash-out rate (cut-off value: 0.677 min(-1)) in the identification of pCR was 
      (92% for reader 1, 91% for reader 2), and (90% for reader 1, 88% for reader 2), 
      respectively. The sensitivity, specificity for predicting pCR using ADC value + 
      washout rate cut off values were 95.4%, 97.7% for reader 1, and 96%, 97% for 
      reader 2, respectively. AUC was 0.981 for reader 1, 0.971 for reader 2. The 
      overall reproducibility of the mean ADC value and wash out rate was excellent 
      (ICC = 0.83-0.90). The ICC values for the mean ADC value, washout rate was 0.89 
      (95% CI 0.84-0.89) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.86-0.91), respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Semi-quantitative parameter (wash-out) derived from DCE-MRI and ADC has the 
      potential to assess the tumor's complete pathologic response. The two parameters 
      using together can offer the best possibility to identify complete response to 
      NAC in MIBC.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures water diffusion in skeletal muscle tissue 
      and allows for muscle assessment in a broad range of neuromuscular diseases. 
      However, current DTI measurements, typically performed using pulsed gradient spin 
      echo (PGSE) diffusion encoding, are limited to the assessment of non-contracted 
      musculature, therefore providing limited insight into muscle contraction 
      mechanisms and contraction abnormalities. In this study, we propose the use of an 
      oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) diffusion encoding strategy for DTI 
      measurements to mitigate the effect of signal voids in contracted muscle and to 
      obtain reliable diffusivity values. Two OGSE sequences with encoding frequencies 
      of 25 and 50 Hz were tested in the lower leg of five healthy volunteers with 
      relaxed musculature and during active dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, and 
      compared with a conventional PGSE approach. A significant reduction of areas of 
      signal voids using OGSE compared with PGSE was observed in the tibialis anterior 
      for the scans obtained in active dorsiflexion and in the soleus during active 
      plantarflexion. The use of PGSE sequences led to unrealistically elevated axial 
      diffusivity values in the tibialis anterior during dorsiflexion and in the soleus 
      during plantarflexion, while the corresponding values obtained using the OGSE 
      sequences were significantly reduced. Similar findings were seen for radial 
      diffusivity, with significantly higher diffusivity measured in plantarflexion in 
      the soleus muscle using the PGSE sequence. Our preliminary results indicate that 
      DTI with OGSE diffusion encoding is feasible in human musculature and allows to 
      quantitatively assess diffusion properties in actively contracting skeletal 
      muscle. OGSE holds great potential to assess microstructural changes occurring in 
      the skeletal muscle during contraction, and for non-invasive assessment of 
      contraction abnormalities in patients with muscle diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical phenotypic heterogeneity represents a major barrier to 
      trials in motor neuron disease (MND) and objective surrogate outcome measures are 
      required, especially for slowly progressive patients. We assessed responsiveness 
      of clinical, electrophysiological and radiological muscle-based assessments to 
      detect MND-related progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, 
      longitudinal cohort study of 29 MND patients and 22 healthy controls was 
      performed. Clinical measures, electrophysiological motor unit number index/size 
      (MUNIX/MUSIX) and relative T2- and diffusion-weighted whole-body muscle magnetic 
      resonance (MR) were assessed three times over 12 months. Multi-variable 
      regression models assessed between-group differences, 
      clinico-electrophysiological associations, and longitudinal changes. Standardized 
      response means (SRMs) assessed sensitivity to change over 12 months. RESULTS: MND 
      patients exhibited 18% higher whole-body mean muscle relative T2-signal than 
      controls (95% CI 7-29%, p < 0.01), maximal in leg muscles (left tibialis anterior 
      71% (95% CI 33-122%, p < 0.01). Clinical and electrophysiological associations 
      were evident. By 12 months, 16 patients had died or could not continue. In the 
      remainder, relative T2-signal increased over 12 months by 14-29% in right 
      tibialis anterior, right quadriceps, bilateral hamstrings and 
      gastrocnemius/soleus (p < 0.01), independent of onset-site, and paralleled 
      progressive weakness and electrophysiological loss of motor units. Highest 
      clinical, electrophysiological and radiological SRMs were found for revised 
      ALS-functional rating scale scores (1.22), tibialis anterior MUNIX (1.59), and 
      relative T2-weighted leg muscle MR (right hamstrings: 0.98), respectively. 
      Diffusion MR detected minimal changes. CONCLUSION: MUNIX and relative T2-weighted 
      MR represent objective surrogate markers of progressive denervation in MND. 
      Radiological changes were maximal in leg muscles, irrespective of clinical 
      onset-site.

TI  - A new framework for analysis of three-dimensional shape and architecture of human 
      skeletal muscles from in vivo imaging data.
PG  - 712-725

AB  - A new framework is presented for comprehensive analysis of the three-dimensional 
      shape and architecture of human skeletal muscles from magnetic resonance and 
      diffusion tensor imaging data. The framework comprises three key features: 1) 
      identification of points on the surface of and inside a muscle that have a 
      correspondence to points on and inside another muscle, 2) reconstruction of 
      average muscle shape and average muscle fiber orientations, and 3) utilization of 
      data on between-muscle variation to visualize and make statistical inferences 
      about changes or differences in muscle shape and architecture. The general use of 
      the framework is demonstrated by its application to three case studies. Analysis 
      of data obtained before and after 8 wk of strength training revealed there was 
      little regional variation in hypertrophy of the vastus medialis and vastus 
      lateralis and no systematic change in pennation angle. Analysis of passive muscle 
      lengthening revealed heterogeneous changes in shape of the medial gastrocnemius 
      and confirmed the ability of the methods to detect subtle changes in muscle fiber 
      orientation. Analysis of the medial gastrocnemius of children with unilateral 
      cerebral palsy showed that muscles in the more-affected limb were shorter, 
      thinner, and less wide than muscles in the less-affected limb and had slightly 
      more pennate muscle fibers in the central and proximal part of the muscle. Among 
      other applications, the framework can be used to explore the mechanics of muscle 
      contraction, investigate adaptations of muscle architecture, build anatomically 
      realistic computational models of skeletal muscles, and compare muscle shape and 
      architecture between species.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Muscle architecture is 
      conventionally measured using simple scalar metrics such as muscle volume and 
      average fascicle lengths. Here, a new framework is proposed for analysis of 
      complex changes in three-dimensional architecture of whole human muscles from 
      magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging data. The general use of the 
      framework is demonstrated through visualization, quantification, and statistical 
      analysis of the effect of strength training, passive lengthening and cerebral 
      palsy on three-dimensional muscle shape and architecture.

LID - e4696
AB  - Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is frequently used to map the 
      disease state and disease progression in the lower extremity muscles of patients 
      with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This is in stark contrast to the almost 
      complete lack of data on the upper extremity muscles, which are essential for 
      carrying out daily activities. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the 
      disease state in the upper arm muscles of patients with SMA in comparison with 
      healthy controls by quantitative assessment of fat fraction, diffusion indices, 
      and water T2 relaxation times, and to relate these measures to muscle force. We 
      evaluated 13 patients with SMA and 15 healthy controls with a 3-T MRI protocol 
      consisting of DIXON, diffusion tensor imaging, and T2 sequences. qMRI measures 
      were compared between groups and related to muscle force measured with 
      quantitative myometry. Fat fraction was significantly increased in all upper arm 
      muscles of the patients with SMA compared with healthy controls and correlated 
      negatively with muscle force. Additionally, fat fraction was heterogeneously 
      distributed within the triceps brachii (TB) and brachialis muscle, but not in the 
      biceps brachii muscle. Diffusion indices and water T2 relaxation times were 
      similar between patients with SMA and healthy controls, but we did find a 
      slightly reduced mean diffusivity (MD), λ1, and λ3 in the TB of patients with 
      SMA. Furthermore, MD was positively correlated with muscle force in the TB of 
      patients with SMA. The variation in fat fraction further substantiates the 
      selective vulnerability of muscles. The reduced diffusion tensor imaging indices, 
      along with the positive correlation of MD with muscle force, point to myofiber 
      atrophy. Our results show the feasibility of qMRI to map the disease state in the 
      upper arm muscles of patients with SMA. Longitudinal data in a larger cohort are 
      needed to further explore qMRI to map disease progression and to capture the 
      possible effects of therapeutic interventions.

      healthy subjects. METHODS: The upper legs of five volunteers were scanned twice 
      on the same day. The right lower legs of five volunteers were scanned twice with 
      the ankle in three positions, i.e. -15° dorsiflexion, 0° neutral position, and 
      30° plantarflexion. The MRI protocols consisted of a noise scan, a 3-point mDixon 
      scan and a DTI scan. Fiber-angle color maps were generated for four muscles in 
      the upper legs and two muscles in the lower leg. Voxel-wise fiber angles (θ) were 
      calculated from the angle between the principal eigenvector of the diffusion 
      tensor and a reference line defined between the origo and insertion points of 
      each muscle. Bland-Altman analysis, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), 
      coefficient of variation (CV%), minimal detectable change (MDC), standard error 
      (SE) and Friedman test were used for assessing the feasibility of this method and 
      in order to have an indication of the repeatability and the sensitivity. RESULTS: 
      Bland-Altman analysis showed good repeatability (CV%<10 and 0.7≤ICC≤0.9) with 
      exception of the Tibialis Anterior (TA) muscle in dorsiflexion position(CV%: 
      12.2) and the Semitendinosus (ST) muscle (left leg) (CV%: 11.4). The best 
      repeatability metrics were found for the SOL muscle in neutral position (CV%: 
      2.6). Changes in average θ in TA and SOL with ankle positions were observed in 
      accordance with expected agonist and antagonist functions of both muscles. For 
      example, for the anterior left compartment the change in fiber angle Δθ with 
      respect to the neutral position Δθ = -1.6° ± 0.8° and 2.2° ± 2.8° (p = 0.008), 
      for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our method 
      facilitates fast inspection and quantification of muscle fiber angles in the 
      lower and upper leg muscles in rest and detection of changes in lower-leg muscle 
      fiber angles with varying ankle angles.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: RA patients often present with low muscle mass and decreased 
      strength. Quantitative MRI offers a non-invasive measurement of muscle status. 
      This study assessed whether MRI-based measurements of T2, fat fraction, diffusion 
      tensor imaging and muscle volume can detect differences between the thigh muscles 
      of RA patients and healthy controls, and assessed the muscle phenotype of 
      different disease stages. METHODS: Thirty-nine RA patients (13 'new RA'-newly 
      diagnosed, treatment naïve, 13 'active RA'-persistent DAS28 >3.2 for >1 year, 13 
      'remission RA'-persistent DAS28 <2.6 for >1 year) and 13 age and gender directly 
      matched healthy controls had an MRI scan of their dominant thigh. All 
      participants had knee extension and flexion torque and grip strength measured. 
      RESULTS: MRI T2 and fat fraction were higher in the three groups of RA patients 
      compared with healthy controls in the thigh muscles. There were no clinically 
      meaningful differences in the mean diffusivity. The muscle volume, handgrip 
      strength, knee extension and flexion were lower in all three groups of RA 
      patients compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Quantitative MRI and muscle 
      strength measurements can potentially detect differences within the muscles 
      between RA patients and healthy controls. These differences may be seen in RA 
      patients who are yet to start treatment, those with persistent active disease, 
      and those who were in clinical remission. This suggests that the muscles in RA 
      patients are affected in the early stages of the disease and that signs of muscle 
      pathology and muscle weakness are still observed in clinical remission.

      obtained from diffusion tensor imaging.
PG  - 131-144
LID - 10.1111/joa.13539 [doi]
AB  - Assessment of regional muscle architecture is primarily done through the study of 
      animals, human cadavers, or using b-mode ultrasound imaging. However, there 
      remain several limitations to how well such measurements represent in vivo human 
      whole muscle architecture. In this study, we developed an approach using 
      diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance imaging to quantify muscle fibre 
      lengths in different muscle regions along a muscle's length and width. We first 
      tested the between-day reliability of regional measurements of fibre lengths in 
      the medial (MG) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and found good reliability for 
      these measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.79 and 
      ICC = 0.84, respectively). We then applied this approach to a group of 32 
      participants including males (n = 18), females (n = 14), young (24 ± 4 years) and 
      older (70 ± 2 years) adults. We assessed the differences in regional muscle fibre 
      lengths between different muscle regions and between individuals. Additionally, 
      we compared regional muscle fibre lengths between sexes, age groups, and muscles. 
      We found substantial variability in fibre lengths between different regions 
      within the same muscle and between the MG and the LG across individuals. At the 
      group level, we found no difference in mean muscle fibre length between males and 
      females, nor between young and older adults, or between the MG and the LG. The 
      high variability in muscle fibre lengths between different regions within the 
      same muscle, possibly expands the functional versatility of the muscle for 
      different task requirements. The high variability between individuals supports 
      the use of subject-specific measurements of muscle fibre lengths when evaluating 
      muscle function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) of skeletal 
      muscle has the potential to be a sensitive diagnostic and/or prognostic tool in 
      complex, enigmatic neuromusculoskeletal conditions such as spinal cord injury and 
      whiplash associated disorder. However, the reliability and reproducibility of 
      clinically accessible DW-MRI parameters in skeletal muscle remains incompletely 
      characterized - even in individuals without neuromusculoskeletal injury - and 
      these parameters have yet to be characterized for many clinical populations. 
      Here, we provide normative measures of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 
      in healthy muscles of the lower limb; assess the rater-based reliability and 
      short- and long-term reproducibility of the ADC in the same muscles; and quantify 
      ADC of these muscles in individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury. 
      METHODS: Twenty individuals without neuromusculoskeletal injury and 14 
      individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) participated in this 
      investigation. We acquired bilateral diffusion-weighted MRI of the lower limb 
      musculature in all participants at 3 T using a multi-shot echo-planar imaging 
      sequence with b-values of 0, 100, 300 and 500 s/mm(2) and diffusion-probing 
      gradients applied in 3 orthogonal directions. Outcome measures included: (1) 
      average ADC in the lateral and medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and 
      soleus of individuals without neurological or musculoskeletal injury; (2) intra- 
      and inter-rater reliability, as well as short and long-term reproducibility of 
      the ADC; and (3) estimation of average muscle ADC in individuals with SCI. 
      RESULTS: Intra- and inter-rater reliability of the ADC averaged 0.89 and 0.79, 
      respectively, across muscles. Least significant change, a measure of temporal 
      reproducibility, was 4.50 and 11.98% for short (same day) and long (9-month) 
      inter-scan intervals, respectively. Average ADC was significantly elevated across 
      muscles in individuals with SCI compared to individuals without neurological or 
      musculoskeletal injury (1.655 vs. 1.615 mm(2)/s, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings provide a foundation for future studies that track longitudinal 
      changes in skeletal muscle ADC of the lower extremity and/or investigate the 
      mechanisms underlying ADC changes in cases of known or suspected pathology.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is becoming a relevant diagnostic tool to 
      understand muscle disease and map muscle recovery processes following physical 
      activity or after injury. Segmenting all the individual leg muscles, necessary 
      for quantification, is still a time-consuming manual process. The purpose of this 
      study was to evaluate the impact of a supervised semi-automatic segmentation 
      pipeline on the quantification of DTI indices in individual upper leg muscles. 
      Longitudinally acquired MRI datasets (baseline, post-marathon and follow-up) of 
      the upper legs of 11 subjects were used in this study. MR datasets consisted of a 
      DTI and Dixon acquisition. Semi-automatic segmentations for the upper leg muscles 
      were performed using a transversal propagation approach developed by Ogier et al 
      on the out-of-phase Dixon images at baseline. These segmentations were 
      longitudinally propagated for the post-marathon and follow-up time points. Manual 
      segmentations were performed on the water image of the Dixon for each of the time 
      points. Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) were calculated to compare the manual 
      and semi-automatic segmentations. Bland-Altman and regression analyses were 
      performed, to evaluate the impact of the two segmentation methods on mean 
      diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) and the third eigenvalue (λ(3) ). 
      The average DSC for all analyzed muscles over all time points was 0.92 ± 0.01, 
      ranging between 0.48 and 0.99. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the 95% limits 
      of agreement for MD, FA and λ(3) ranged between 0.5% and 3.0% for the transversal 
      propagation and between 0.7% and 3.0% for the longitudinal propagations. 
      Similarly, regression analysis showed good correlation for MD, FA and λ(3) (r = 
      0.99, p < 60; 0.0001). In conclusion, the supervised semi-automatic segmentation 
      framework successfully quantified DTI indices in the upper-leg muscles compared 
      with manual segmentation while only requiring manual input of 30% of the slices, 
      resulting in a threefold reduction in segmentation time.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in parameters of 
      diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and minimum apparent diffusion coefficient 
      (ADC(min)) between benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In this prospective study, 43 patients were scanned using a DKI protocol 
      on a 3-T MR scanner. Eligibility criteria were: non-fatty, non-cystic soft tissue 
      or osteolytic tumors; > 2 cm; location in the retroperitoneum, pelvis, leg, or 
      neck; and no prior treatment. They were clinically or histologically diagnosed as 
      benign (n = 27) or malignant (n = 16). In the DKI protocol, diffusion-weighted 
      imaging was performed using four b values (0-2000 s/mm(2)) and 21 diffusion 
      directions. Mean kurtosis (MK) values were calculated on the MR console. A 
      recently developed software application enabling reliable calculation was used 
      for DKI analysis. RESULTS: MK showed a strong correction with ADC(min) 
      (Spearman's rs = 0.95). Both MK and ADC(min) values differed between benign and 
      malignant tumors (p < 0.01). For benign and malignant tumors, the mean MK values 
      (± SD) were 0.49 ± 0.17 and 1.14 ± 0.30, respectively, and ADC(min) values were 
      1.54 ± 0.47 and 0.49 ± 0.17 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively. At cutoffs of 
      MK = 0.81 and ADC(min) = 0.77 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, the specificity and sensitivity 
      for diagnosis of malignant tumors were 96.3 and 93.8% for MK and 96.3 and 93.8% 
      for ADC(min), respectively. The areas under the curve were 0.97 and 0.99 for MK 
      and ADC(min), respectively (p = 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: MK and ADC(min) showed high 
      diagnostic accuracy and strong correlation, reflecting the accuracy of MK. 
      However, no clear added value of DKI could be demonstrated in differentiating 
      musculoskeletal tumors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess in-vivo cross-sectional and 3D morphology of human motor 
      units in hand, forearm and lower leg muscles using magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI). METHODS: Diffusion weighted MRI was used with in-scanner electrical 
      stimulation in healthy controls to image motor units at a single slice in lower 
      leg, forearm and hand muscles (n = 6) and multiple slices in the lower leg for 3D 
      assessment (n = 7). RESULTS: Motor unit cross-sectional area (CSA) and maximum 
      Feret diameter (FD(max)) did not differ between the lower leg (CSA: 
      22.4 ± 8.4 mm(2); FD(max): 8.7 ± 2.4 mm), forearm (CSA: 23.6 ± 14.1 mm(2); 
      FD(max): 9.0 ± 3.3 mm) and hand (CSA: 26.8 ± 12.8 mm(2) and FD(max): 
      9.6 ± 2.7 mm) (ANOVA; p = 0.487 and p = 0.587, respectively). Lower leg motor 
      units were 8.0 ± 3.8 cm long with largest CSA in the motor unit's middle section. 
      3D motor unit imaging revealed a complex structure with several units splitting 
      and re-forming along their length. CONCLUSIONS: Motor unit MRI (MUMRI) can be 
      applied to upper limb muscles, and can reveal the 3D structure of human motor 
      units in-vivo. SIGNIFICANCE: MUMRI provides the first in-vivo 2D images of upper 
      limb motor units and 3D images of lower leg motor units. 3D imaging suggest a 
      more complex human motor unit structure than previously thought.

TI  - MRI detects peripheral nerve and adjacent muscle pathology in non-systemic 
      vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN).
PG  - 975-981
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09224-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and disease monitoring of non-systemic vasculitic 
      neuropathy (NSVN) are based on electrophysiological and clinical measures. 
      However, these methods are insensitive to detect subtle differences of axonal 
      injury. We here assessed the utility of a multiparametric MRI protocol to 
      quantify axonal injury and neurogenic muscle damage in NSVN. METHODS: Ten NSVN 
      patients and ten age-matched controls were investigated in this single-center 
      prospective study. All participants were assessed by diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) of the tibial nerve and multiecho Dixon MRI of soleus and gastrocnemius 
      muscles. These data were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological data. 
      RESULTS: DTI scans of the tibial nerves of patients with NSVN showed 
      significantly lower mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values (0.32 ± 0.02) compared 
      to healthy controls (0.42 ± 0.01). FA values of NSVN patients correlated 
      negatively with clinical measures of pain. Multiecho Dixon MRI scans revealed 
      significantly higher intramuscular fat fractions in the soleus muscle 
      (19.86 ± 6.18% vs. 5.86 ± 0.74%, p = 0.0015) and gastrocnemius muscle 
      (26.09 ± 6.21% vs. 3.59 ± 0.82%, p = 0.0002) in NSVN patients compared to healthy 
      controls. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a proof of concept that MRI can render 
      information about nerve integrity and muscle pathology in NSVN. Further studies 
      are warranted to evaluate DTI and multiecho Dixon MRI as surrogate markers in 
      NSVN.

      STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 3 T/T(1) -weighted (T(1) -w), T(2) -weighted (T(2) -w), 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CET(1) -w) 
      images. ASSESSMENT: Three DL models based, respectively, on the sagittal, 
      coronal, and axial MR images were constructed to predict the malignancy of 
      tumors. Blinded to the prediction results, a group of specialists made 
      independent initial diagnoses for each patient by reading all image sequences. 
      One month after the initial diagnoses, the same group of doctors made another 
      round of diagnoses knowing the malignancy of each tumor predicted by the three 
      models. The reference standard was the pathological diagnosis of malignancy. 
      STATISTICAL TESTS: Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (all with 95% 
      confidential intervals [CI]) corresponding to each diagnostic test were computed. 
      Chi-square tests were used to assess the differences in those parameters with and 
      without DL models. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
      RESULTS: The developed models significantly improved the diagnostic sensitivities 
      of two oncologists by 0.15 (95% CI: 0.06-0.24) and 0.36 (95% CI: 0.24-0.28), one 
      radiologist by 0.12 (95% CI: 0.04-0.20), and three of the four orthopedists, 
      respectively, by 0.12 (95% CI: 0.04-0.20), 0.29 (95% CI: 0.18-0.40), and 0.23 
      (95% CI: 0.13-0.33), without impairing any of their diagnostic specificities (all 
      P > 0.128). DATA CONCLUSION: The DL models developed can significantly improve 
      the performance of doctors with different training and experience in diagnosing 
      musculoskeletal tumors. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate the performance of a magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI)-based radiomics nomogram for prediction of response of patients 
      with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). 
      METHODS: A total of 70 patients with clinical T2-4aN0M0 MIBC were enrolled in 
      this retrospective study. For each patient, 1316 radiomics features were 
      extracted from T2-weighted images (T2WI), diffusion-weighted images (DWI), and 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The variance threshold algorithm and 
      the Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test were applied to select optimal 
      features. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to eliminate 
      irrelevant features, and the retained features were incorporated into the final 
      single-modality radiomics model. Combined radiomic models were generated by 
      combining single-modality radiomics models. A radiomics nomogram, incorporating 
      radiomics signatures and independent clinical risk factors, was developed to 
      determine whether the performance of the model in predicting tumor response to 
      NAC could be further improved. RESULTS: Based on pathological T stage 
      post-surgery, 36 (51%) patients were classified as good responders (GR) and 34 
      (49%) patients as non-good responders (non-GR). In addition, 3 single-modality 
      radiomics models and 4 combined radiomics models were established. Among all 
      radiomics models, the combined radiomics model based on T2WI_Score, DWI_Score, 
      and ADC_Score yielded the highest area under the receiver operating 
      characteristics curve (AUC) (0.967, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.930-0.995). A 
      radiomics nomogram, integrating the clinical T stage and 3 single-modality 
      radiomics models, yielded a higher AUC (0.973, 95%CI: 0.934-0.998) than other 
      combined radiomics models. CONCLUSION: The proposed MRI-based radiomics nomogram 
      has the potential to be used as a non-invasive tool for the quantitatively 
      prediction of tumor response to NAC in patients with MIBC.

AB  - Functional imaging, which provides information of how tissues function rather 
      than structural information, is well established in neuro- and cardiac imaging. 
      Many musculoskeletal structures, such as ligaments, fascia and mineralized bone, 
      have by definition a mainly structural role and clearly don't have the same 
      functional capacity as the brain, heart, liver or kidney. The main functionally 
      responsive musculoskeletal tissues are the bone marrow, muscle and nerve and, as 
      such, magnetic resonance (MR) functional imaging has primarily addressed these 
      areas. Proton or phosphorus spectroscopy, other fat quantification techniques, 
      perfusion imaging, BOLD imaging, diffusion and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are 
      the main functional techniques applied. The application of these techniques in 
      the musculoskeletal system has mainly been research orientated where they have 
      already greatly enhanced our understanding of marrow physiology, muscle 
      physiology and neural function. Going forwards, they will have a greater clinical 
      impact helping to bridge the disconnect often seen between structural appearances 
      and clinical symptoms, allowing a greater understanding of disease processes and 
      earlier recognition of disease, improving prognostic prediction and optimizing 
      the monitoring of treatment effect.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography of the sciatic nerve: assessment of 
      fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient values relative to the 
      piriformis muscle, a preliminary study.
PG  - 309-314
LID - 10.1007/s00256-016-2557-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Piriformis muscle syndrome (PMS) is underdiagnosed. To evaluate the 
      potential of diffusion tensor imaging and diffusion tensor tractography as 
      innovative tools for the diagnosis of PMS by functional assessment of the sciatic 
      nerve, the aims of this study are to assess the reproducibility and to evaluate 
      the changes in the parameters at levels proximal and distal to the piriformis. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) of the sciatic nerve at three levels were quantified twice each 
      by two examiners using the fiber-tracking method. In the first part of the study, 
      laterality and reproducibility were evaluated using intraclass correlation 
      coefficients (ICC) in ten healthy volunteers. In the second part of the study, 
      the healthy side and symptomatic side were assessed in ten consecutive patients 
      with sciatica. There were three patients with no findings on lumbar magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: There was no laterality in either FA or ADC 
      values in asymptomatic patients at any level. The mean intra-rater ICC was 0.90 
      and the mean inter-rater ICC was 0.87. FA was significantly lower and ADC 
      significantly higher on the symptomatic side at each level in patients with 
      sciatica. In the three sciatica patients with no findings on lumbar MRI, FA was 
      significantly lower and ADC was significantly higher only at levels distal to the 
      piriformis. These patients experienced full pain relief after ultrasound-guided 
      injection of local anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging and 
      diffusion tensor tractography might be innovative tools for the diagnosis of PMS.

PG  - 635-641
LID - 10.1038/s41393-020-00539-8 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pelvic MRI 
      muscle signal changes and their association with early heterotopic ossification 
      (HO) in patients with spinal cord injuries. SETTING: National Spinal Injuries 
      Unit, Stoke Mandeville, UK. METHODS: Forty patients were imaged with at least two 
      interval magnetic resonance (MR) studies of the pelvis in the first 6 months 
      following a spinal cord injury. Scans were reviewed and scored for heterotopic 
      ossification, muscle signal change and extent of muscle involvement. RESULTS: 
      Muscle signal change was present in 28 (70%) on the initial MRI and 31 (77%) by 
      the second study. Six patients developed MR changes of prodromal or immature 
      heterotopic ossification (15%). No restricted diffusion was demonstrated and no 
      patient developed mature HO. Patients developing MR changes of early HO were more 
      likely to have grade 3 muscle changes. CONCLUSION: Increased T2 muscle signal is 
      common following cord injury, is frequently progressive in the subacute period 
      and is associated with complete injury and early MR signs of heterotopic 
      ossification.

TI  - Differences between muscle from osteoporotic and osteoarthritic subjects: in 
      vitro study by diffusion-tensor MRI and histological findings.
PG  - 2489-2499

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are strongly coupled with alterations 
      of muscles quality and fats metabolism. However, there are no studies for 
      investigating possible differences between osteoporotic and osteoarthritic 
      muscles. Understanding muscle-bone and muscle-cartilage interactions would be of 
      high clinical value. AIM: Investigate potential microstructural and physiological 
      differences between osteoporotic and osteoarthritic muscles by diffusion Nuclear 
      Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging (diffusion MRI) and histological findings. 
      METHODS: Vastus-lateralis muscles excised from osteoporotic (n = 26, T 
      Score <  - 2.5, Kellgren-Lawrence ≤ 2) and osteoarthritic (n = 26, T 
      Score >  - 2.5, Kellgren--Lawrence 3 and 4) age-matched women were investigated 
      by NMR relaxometry, diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) at 9.4 T, and histological 
      techniques. Intramyocellular (IMCL) and extramyocellular (EMCL) lipid were 
      quantified. The percentage and mean diameters of fibers I and II were evaluated. 
      Relationship between mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), the DTI 
      eigenvalues (λ(1), λ(2), λ(3)), histological findings in muscles and clinical 
      data (Kellgren-Lawrence and T score, age, menopausal age, body mass index) were 
      studied. Pairwise comparisons between groups were made using one-way analysis of 
      variance and correlation between variables was assessed with linear correlation 
      analysis (Pearson's r coefficient). RESULTS: Osteoporotic muscles showed higher 
      MD, λ(1,) λ(2), λ(3) compared to osteoarthritis ones. This is explainable with a 
      significant higher density of IMCL droplets found inside the osteoarthritic 
      muscles and a large amount of fibrotic tissue and IMCL infiltration between 
      fibers, i.e. in endomysium and perimysium that lead to a more hindered diffusion. 
      Furthermore, histological analysis suggests mitochondrial degeneration as the 
      origin of the greatest amount of IMCL droplets in osteoarthritic muscles. 
      CONCLUSION: This work highlights differences between muscles of osteoporotic and 
      osteoarthritic subjects that can be quantified by NMR DTI investigations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the potential value of magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in characterizing 
      changes in the cervical spinal cord and peripheral nerve roots in vivo in 
      patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). METHODS: We developed an MRI 
      protocol with 4 sequences to investigate the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots 
      on a 3 Tesla MRI system. We used 2 anatomical MRI sequences to investigate 
      cross-sectional area (CSA) at each spinal segment and the diameter of ventral and 
      dorsal nerve roots, and two diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques to estimate 
      the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) 
      in 10 SMA patients and 20 healthy controls. RESULTS: There were no significant 
      differences in CSA (p > .1), although an 8.5% reduction of CSA in patients 
      compared to healthy controls was apparent at segment C7. DTI data showed a higher 
      AD in grey matter of patients compared to healthy controls (p = .033). 
      Significantly lower MD, AD and RD values were found in rostral nerve roots 
      (C3-C5) in patients (p < .045). CONCLUSIONS: We showed feasibility of an advanced 
      3 T MRI protocol that allowed differences to be determined between patients and 
      healthy controls, confirming the potential of this technique to assess 
      pathological mechanisms in SMA. After further development and confirmation of 
      findings in a larger sample, these techniques may be used to study disease course 
      of SMA in vivo and evaluate response to survival motor neuron (SMN) augmenting 
      therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate differences in diffusion parameters in thigh muscles in 
      patients with glycogen storage disease type V (McArdle disease) using muscle 
      diffusion tensor imaging (mDTI) compared to healthy controls METHODS: In this 
      prospective study, we evaluated thigh muscles from hip to knee of 10 McArdle 
      patients (5 female, mean age 33.7 ± 14.4 years) and 10 healthy age- and 
      gender-matched volunteers. MRI scans were performed at 3 T and comprised mDTI, 
      T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging between May 2015 and May 2017. Needle biopsy 
      of the vastus lateralis muscle was performed in three McArdle patients. The 
      muscle tissue was analyzed by using histochemical and enzyme-histochemical 
      techniques for glycogen content and histopathological changes. Mean values of the 
      eigenvalues (λ(1)-λ(3)), fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) 
      were obtained for the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, rectus femoris, biceps 
      femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus and compared between groups using 
      Student's t tests, as well as ANCOVA; significance level was set at p < 0.05. 
      RESULTS: Needle biopsy showed intracellular glycogen accumulation in skeletal 
      muscle fibers of three McArdle patients. Extracellular histopathological changes 
      were not found. Muscle DTI analysis did not show statistically significant 
      differences between patients and controls for any of the muscles. CONCLUSION: 
      Despite intracellular glycogen accumulation in the three biopsy samples, mDTI 
      parameters were not altered in McArdle patients compared to controls. We conclude 
      that the currently used mDTI acquisition and processing lack the sensitivity to 
      detect intracellular changes due to accumulated glycogen in this cohort of 
      McArdle patients. KEY POINTS: • Despite intracellular glycogen accumulation in 
      three examined biopsy samples, mDTI parameters were not altered in McArdle 
      patients compared to controls. • In its current form, diffusion MR does not 
      provide additional information in quantifying intracellular glycogen 
      accumulations within skeletal muscle fibers in McArdle patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the test-retest variability of both diffusion parameters 
      and fat fraction (FF) estimates in normal muscle, and to assess differences in 
      normal values between muscles in the thigh. METHODS: 29 healthy volunteers (mean 
      age 37 years, range 20-60 years, 17/29 males) completed the study. Magnetic 
      resonance images of the mid-thigh were acquired using a stimulated echo 
      acquisition mode-echoplanar imaging (STEAM-EPI) imaging sequence, to assess 
      diffusion, and 2-point Dixon imaging, to assess FF. Imaging was repeated in 19 
      participants after a 30 min interval in order to assess test-retest variability 
      of the measurements. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for 
      test-retest variability were 0.99 [95% confidence interval, (CI): 0.98, 1] for 
      FF, 0.94 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.97) for mean diffusivity and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.96) 
      for fractional anisotropy (FA). FF was higher in the hamstrings than the 
      quadriceps by a mean difference of 1.81% (95% CI:1.63, 2.00)%, p < 0.001. Mean 
      diffusivity was significantly lower in the hamstrings than the quadriceps (0.26 
      (0.13, 0.39) x10(-)(3) mm(2)s(-1), p < 0.001) whereas fractional anisotropy was 
      significantly higher in the hamstrings relative to the quadriceps with a mean 
      difference of 0.063 (0.05, 0.07), p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown 
      excellent test-retest, variability in MR-based FF and diffusion measurements and 
      demonstrated significant differences in these measures between hamstrings and 
      quadriceps in the healthy thigh. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Test-retest variability 
      is excellent for STEAM-EPI diffusion and 2-point Dixon-based FF measurements in 
      the healthy muscle. Inter- and intraobserver variability were excellent for 
      region of interest placement for STEAM-EPI diffusion and 2-point Dixon-based FF 
      measurements in the healthy muscle. There are significant differences in FF and 
      diffusion measurements between the hamstrings and quadriceps in the normal 
      muscle.

TI  - Global sensitivity analysis of skeletal muscle dMRI metrics: Effects of 
      microstructural and pulse parameters.
PG  - 1458-1470
LID - 10.1002/mrm.28014 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Estimating microstructural parameters of skeletal muscle from diffusion 
      MRI (dMRI) signal requires understanding the relative importance of both 
      microstructural and dMRI sequence parameters on the signal. This study seeks to 
      determine the sensitivity of dMRI signal to variations in microstructural and 
      dMRI sequence parameters, as well as assess the effect of noise on sensitivity. 
      METHODS: Using a cylindrical myocyte model of skeletal muscle, numerical 
      solutions of the Bloch-Torrey equation were used to calculate global sensitivity 
      indices of dMRI metrics (FA, RD, MD, λ1 , λ2 , λ3 ) for wide ranges of 
      microstructural and dMRI sequence parameters. The microstructural parameters 
      were: myocyte diameter, volume fraction, membrane permeability, intra- and 
      extracellular diffusion coefficients, and intra- and extracellular T2 times. Two 
      separate pulse sequences were examined, a PGSE and a generalized 
      diffusion-weighted sequence that accommodates a larger range of diffusion times. 
      The effect of noise and signal averaging on the sensitivity of the dMRI metrics 
      was examined by adding synthetic noise to the simulated signal. RESULTS: Among 
      the examined parameters, the intracellular diffusion coefficient has the 
      strongest effect, and myocyte diameter is more influential than permeability for 
      FA and RD. The sensitivity indices do not vary significantly between the two 
      pulse sequences. Also, noise strongly affects the sensitivity of the dMRI signal 
      to microstructural variations. CONCLUSIONS: With the identification of key 
      microstructural features that affect dMRI measurements, the reported sensitivity 
      results can help interpret dMRI measurements of skeletal muscle in terms of the 
      underlying microstructure and further develop parsimonious dMRI models of 
      skeletal muscle.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of human skeletal muscles: gender-, 
      age- and muscle-related differences in apparent diffusion coefficient.
PG  - 69-78
LID - 10.1016/j.mri.2008.05.011 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of skeletal muscle 
      based on signal intensity (SI) attenuation vs. increasing b values and to 
      determine ADC differences in skeletal muscles between genders, age groups and 
      muscles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion-weighted images (b values in the range 
      of 0-750 s/mm2 at increments of 50 s/mm2) of the ankle dorsiflexors (116 
      subjects) and the erector spinae muscles (86 subjects) were acquired with a 1.5-T 
      MR device. From the two different slopes obtained in SI vs. b-value logarithmic 
      plots, ADCb0-50 (b values=0 and 50 s/mm2) reflected diffusion and perfusion, 
      while ADCb50-750 (b values in the range of 50-750 s/mm2 at increments of 50 
      s/mm2) approximated the true diffusion coefficient. Moreover, to evaluate whether 
      this b-value combination is appropriate for assessing the flow component within 
      muscles, diffusion-weighted images of the ankle dorsiflexors (10 subjects) were 
      obtained before and during temporal arterial occlusion. RESULTS: ADCb0-50 and 
      ADCb50-750 were found to be 2.64x10(-3) and 1.44x10(-3) mm2/s in the ankle 
      dorsiflexors, and 3.02x10(-3) and 1.49x10(-3) mm2/s in the erector spinae 
      muscles, respectively. ADCb0-50 was significantly higher than ADCb50-750 in each 
      muscle (P<.01). The erector spinae muscles showed significantly higher ADC values 
      than the ankle dorsiflexors (P<.01). However, for each muscle, there were few 
      significant gender- and age-related ADC differences. Following temporal 
      occlusion, ADCb0-50 of the ankle dorsiflexors decreased significantly from 2.49 
      to 1.6x10(-3) mm2/s (P<.01); however, ADCb50-750 showed no significant change. 
      CONCLUSION: Based on the SI attenuation pattern, muscle ADC could be divided into 
      ADC that reflects both diffusion and perfusion, and ADC that approximates a true 
      diffusion coefficient. There were significant differences in ADC of functionally 
      distinct muscles. However, we barely found any gender- or age-related ADC 
      differences for each muscle.

      between fiber length and diffusion coefficients.
PG  - 1813-1824
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3661 [doi]
AB  - In this study we investigated the changes in fiber length and diffusion 
      parameters as a consequence of passive lengthening and stretching of the calf 
      muscles. We hypothesized that changes in radial diffusivity (RD) are caused by 
      changes in the muscle fiber cross sectional area (CSA) as a consequence of 
      lengthening and shortening of the muscle. Diffusion Tensor MRI (DT-MRI) 
      measurements were made twice in five healthy volunteers, with the foot in three 
      different positions (30° plantarflexion, neutral position and 15° dorsiflexion). 
      The muscles of the calf were manually segmented on co-registered high resolution 
      anatomical scans, and maps of RD and axial diffusivity (AD) were reconstructed 
      from the DT-MRI data. Fiber tractography was performed and mean fiber length was 
      calculated for each muscle group. Significant negative correlations were found 
      between the changes in RD and changes in fiber length in the dorsiflexed and 
      plantarflexed positions, compared with the neutral foot position. Changes in AD 
      did not correlate with changes in fiber length. Assuming a simple cylindrical 
      model with constant volume for the muscle fiber, the changes in the muscle fiber 
      CSA were calculated from the changes in fiber length. In line with our 
      hypothesis, we observed a significant positive correlation of the CSA with the 
      measured changes in RD. In conclusion, we showed that changes in diffusion 
      coefficients induced by passive muscle stretching and lengthening can be 
      explained by changes in muscle CSA, advancing the physiological interpretation of 
      parameters derived from skeletal muscle DT-MRI.

TI  - The relationship between quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of the ankle 
      plantar flexors, muscle function during walking and maximal strength in people 
      with neuromuscular diseases.

LID - S0268-0033(22)00039-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2022.105609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Progression of plantar flexor weakness in neuromuscular diseases is 
      usually monitored by muscle strength measurements, although they poorly relate to 
      muscle function during walking. Pathophysiological changes such as intramuscular 
      adipose tissue affect dynamic muscle function independent from isometric 
      strength. Diffusion tensor imaging and T2 imaging are quantitative MRI measures 
      reflecting muscular pathophysiological changes, and are therefore potential 
      biomarkers to monitor plantar flexor functioning during walking in people with 
      neuromuscular diseases. METHODS: In fourteen individuals with plantar flexor 
      weakness diffusion tensor imaging and T2 scans of the plantar flexors were 
      obtained, and the diffusion indices fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity 
      calculated. With a dynamometer, maximal isometric plantar flexor strength was 
      measured. 3D gait analysis was used to assess maximal ankle moment and power 
      during walking. FINDINGS: Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and T2 
      relaxation time all moderately correlated with maximal plantar flexor strength 
      (r > 0.512). Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were not related with 
      ankle moment or power (r < 0.288). T2 relaxation time was strongly related to 
      ankle moment (r = -0.789) and ankle power (r = -0.798), and moderately related to 
      maximal plantar flexor strength (r < 0.600). INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, T2 
      relaxation time, indicative of multiple pathophysiological changes, was strongly 
      related to plantar flexor function during walking, while fractional anisotropy 
      and mean diffusivity, indicative of fiber size, only related to maximal plantar 
      flexor strength. This indicates that these measures may be suitable to monitor 
      muscle function and gain insights into the pathophysiological changes underlying 
      a poor plantar flexor functioning during gait in people with neuromuscular 
      diseases.

TI  - Diffusion-tensor MR imaging of corticospinal tract in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis and progressive muscular atrophy.
PG  - 258-64
AB  - PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate several diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance 
      (MR) imaging indexes (mean diffusivity [MD], fractional anisotropy [FA], and 
      eigenvalues) of corticospinal tract impairment in patients with progressive 
      muscular atrophy (PMA) and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study had institutional review board approval, and 
      written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Eight male patients with 
      PMA (mean age, 63 years +/- 13 [standard deviation]), eighteen patients with ALS 
      (14 men and four women; mean age, 64 years +/- 7), and twelve control subjects 
      (four men and eight women; mean age, 65 years +/- 6) underwent diffusion-tensor 
      MR imaging at which 25 spin-echo echo-planar imaging diffusion-weighted images (b 
      = 1000 sec/mm2) were acquired along noncollinear directions. MD and FA were 
      measured along the corticospinal tracts in each patient and subject. Changes in 
      diffusion along and orthogonal to fiber bundles in patients were evaluated by 
      using diffusion-tensor eigenvalues. Differences in diffusion-tensor imaging 
      indexes between patients with PMA and those with ALS, as compared with these 
      indexes in control subjects, were evaluated with Mann-Whitney testing. 
      Correlations between diffusion-tensor imaging indexes and clinical variables were 
      estimated with Pearson and Spearman rank correlation testing. RESULTS: As 
      compared with MD (697.1 x 10(-6) mm2/sec +/- 28.1) and FA (0.585 +/- 0.032) in 
      control subjects, MD was typically significantly increased (734.7 x 10(-6) 
      mm2/sec +/- 41.2, P = .035) and FA significantly decreased (0.534 +/- 0.053, P = 
      .037) along the corticospinal tracts in patients with ALS, while these parameters 
      showed no significant change in patients with PMA (MD, 707.0 x 10(-6) mm2/sec +/- 
      44.2; FA, 0.559 +/- 0.028). Estimation of diffusion-tensor eigenvalues revealed 
      normal diffusion along fiber tracts in all patients, while diffusion was 
      increased orthogonal to fiber tracts only in patients with typical ALS. In 
      patients with ALS, MD correlated with disease duration while FA correlated with 
      disease severity. CONCLUSION: Diffusion-tensor MR imaging reveals corticospinal 
      tract impairment in ALS but not in PMA.

TI  - Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Disease.

AB  - Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) describes the development and use 
      of MRI to quantify physical, chemical, and/or biological properties of living 
      systems. Neuromuscular diseases often exhibit a temporally varying, spatially 
      heterogeneous, and multi-faceted pathology. The goal of this protocol is to 
      characterize this pathology using qMRI methods. The MRI acquisition protocol 
      begins with localizer images (used to locate the position of the body and tissue 
      of interest within the MRI system), quality control measurements of relevant 
      magnetic field distributions, and structural imaging for general anatomical 
      characterization. The qMRI portion of the protocol includes measurements of the 
      longitudinal and transverse relaxation time constants (T1 and T2, respectively). 
      Also acquired are diffusion-tensor MRI data, in which water diffusivity is 
      measured and used to infer pathological processes such as edema. Quantitative 
      magnetization transfer imaging is used to characterize the relative tissue 
      content of macromolecular and free water protons. Lastly, fat-water MRI methods 
      are used to characterize fibro-adipose tissue replacement of muscle. In addition 
      to describing the data acquisition and analysis procedures, this paper also 
      discusses the potential problems associated with these methods, the analysis and 
      interpretation of the data, MRI safety, and strategies for artifact reduction and 
      protocol optimization.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of extraocular muscles in patients 
      with Grave's ophthalmopathy using turbo field echo with diffusion-sensitized 
      driven-equilibrium preparation.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to correlate diffusivity of extraocular 
      muscles, measured by three-dimensional turbo field echo (3DTFE) magnetic 
      resonance (MR) imaging using diffusion-sensitized driven-equilibrium preparation, 
      with their size and activity in patients with Grave's ophthalmopathy. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with Grave's ophthalmopathy were included. 
      There were 17 women and 6 men with a mean age of 55.8±12.6 (SD) years (range: 
      26-83 years). 3DTFE with diffusion-sensitized driven-equilibrium MR images were 
      obtained with b-values of 0 and 500s/mm(2). The apparent diffusion coefficient 
      (ADC) of extraocular muscles was measured on coronal reformatted MR images. 
      Signal intensities of extraocular muscles on conventional MR images were compared 
      to those of normal-appearing white matter, and cross-sectional areas of the 
      muscles were also measured. The clinical activity score was also evaluated. 
      Statistical analyses were performed with Pearson correlation and Mann-Whitney U 
      tests. RESULTS: On 3DTFE with diffusion-sensitized driven-equilibrium 
      preparation, the mean ADC of the extraocular muscles was 2.23±0.37 
      (SD)×10(-3)mm2/s (range: 1.70×10(-3)-3.11×10(-3)mm(2)/s). There was a 
      statistically significant moderate correlation between ADC and the size of the 
      muscles (r=0.61). There were no statistically significant correlations between 
      ADC and signal intensity on conventional MR and the clinical activity score. 
      CONCLUSION: 3DTFE with diffusion-sensitized driven-equilibrium preparation 
      technique allows quantifying diffusivity of extraocular muscles in patients with 
      Grave's ophthalmopathy. The diffusivity of the extraocular muscles on 3DTFE with 
      diffusion-sensitized driven-equilibrium preparation MR images moderately 
      correlates with their size.

TI  - Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy to Assess Leg Muscle Macrostructure 
      and Microstructure in Healthy Older Women: A Feasibility Assessment.
PG  - 43-54
LID - S1939-8654(16)30115-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmir.2016.09.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) scanning techniques, such as 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) permit 
      microstructural evaluation of water diffusivity and intramyocellular lipid 
      content, respectively. We aimed to determine the feasibility of performing 
      advanced MR scanning (proton density [PD] weighted imaging, DTI, and (1)H-MRS) to 
      evaluate properties of leg muscles in older women with respect to: (1) 
      participant recruitment using three community-based strategies; (2) participant 
      tolerance to the MRI scan acquisition protocol; and (3) scan acquisition and 
      analyses protocols. METHODS: Recruitment feasibility was evaluated based on the 
      number of participants enrolled using various strategies. Participant tolerance 
      was feasible if the scanning session was uninterrupted and image artifacts were 
      absent. Optimal PD imaging, DTI, and (1)H-MRS acquisition and analyses protocols 
      were established. RESULTS: Nine women (mean age = 71 years) were recruited over 
      four months. The acquisition protocol was well tolerated by all participants. 
      Adaptations were required for women with short stature and vertebral fracture 
      risk. PD-weighted image analyses were improved by using the phased array 
      uniformity enhancement filter to increase tissue contrast. CONCLUSIONS: It is 
      feasible to use a combination of MR scanning methods to evaluate muscle 
      macrostructure and microstructure in the leg of older women. Our findings suggest 
      that advanced MR scanning methods can be used for future studies interested in 
      quantifying components of muscle structure in older women, but prospective 
      studies are needed to confirm whether change in microstructure can be detected in 
      response to an intervention.

TI  - Lumbar Muscle Structure Predicts Operational Postures in Active-Duty Marines.
PG  - 613-621
LID - 10.2519/jospt.2018.7865 [doi]
AB  - Background The relationship between lumbar spine posture and muscle structure is 
      not well understood. Objectives To investigate the predictive capacity of muscle 
      structure on lumbar spine posture in active-duty Marines. Methods Forty-three 
      Marines were scanned in this cross-sectional study, using an upright magnetic 
      resonance imaging scanner while standing without load and standing, sitting, and 
      prone on elbows with body armor. Cobb, horizontal, and sacral angles were 
      measured. Marines were then scanned while unloaded in supine using a supine 
      magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The imaging protocol consisted of T2 
      intervertebral disc mapping; high-resolution, anatomical, fat-water separation, 
      and diffusion tensor imaging to quantify disc hydration and muscle volume, fat 
      fraction, and restricted diffusion profiles in the lumbar muscles. A stepwise 
      multiple linear regression model was used to identify physiological measures 
      predictive of lumbar spine posture. Results The multiple regression model 
      demonstrated that fractional anisotropy of the erector spinae was a significant 
      predictor of lumbar posture for 7 of 18 dependent variables measured, and 
      explained 20% to 35% of the variance in each model. Decreased fractional 
      anisotropy of the erector spinae predicted decreased lordosis, lumbosacral 
      extension, and anterior pelvic tilt. Conclusion Fractional anisotropy is 
      inversely related with muscle fiber size, which is associated with the isometric 
      force-generating capacity of a muscle fiber. This suggests that stronger erector 
      spinae muscles predict decreased lordosis, lumbosacral extension, and anterior 
      pelvic tilt in a highly trained population. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) is a useful tool 
      for evaluating muscle layer invasion of bladder cancer (BCa) on magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI). PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of 
      bladder MRI to detect the muscle layer invasion of BCa using VI-RADS score and 
      quantitative MRI parameters. METHODS: Preoperative bladder MRI was performed in 
      73 BCa patients. Two observers independently evaluated the MR blinded to 
      histopathological data and classified the tumors according to VI-RADS criteria. 
      Moreover, the quantitative parameters (maximum tumor diameter; Dmax, tumor 
      contact length; TCL, and tumor apparent diffusion coefficient; ADC values) were 
      independently measured by observers. The diagnostic performance of the VI-RADS 
      score and quantitative values were evaluated by using receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) analysis. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using the 
      weighted-kappa coefficient (κ). RESULTS: For the VI-RADS score, the AUC (area 
      under the curve) was 0.968 and accuracy was 90.4% for Observer 1, and AUC was 
      0.953, accuracy was 89% for Observer 2. The AUC of TCL, TCL/DMax, and ADC values 
      was 0.918, 0.675, and 0.832. In patients with a VI-RADS score ≥ 3, when a 
      threshold value of TCL > 19.5 mm is used as complementary to the VI-RADS score, 
      the accuracy of MRI for Observer-1 increases 100% and 97.26% for Observer-2. 
      There was a good-excellent agreement between the observers in assessing the 
      VI-RADS scores and quantitative parameters. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of bladder MRI 
      using both VI-RADS criteria and TCL is successful and highly reproducible for 
      detecting muscle layer invasion in patients with BCa.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate skeletal muscle denervation 
      using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Sciatic nerve axotomy was performed in a group of nine New Zealand White 
      rabbits, and electromyographic (EMG), pathological, and DWMRI studies were 
      conducted on ipsilateral hamstring muscles 1 and 8 days after axotomy. In 
      addition, DWMRI studies were carried out on leg muscles of ten patients with 
      acute and subacute lumbosacral radiculopathy. RESULTS: High intensity signals on 
      short tau inversion recovery (STIR) magnetic resonance imaging and an increased 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were observed in denervated muscles of the 
      animals 1 and 8 days after axotomy as well as in denervated muscles of the 
      patients with radiculopathy. In the clinical study, ADC was 1.26 +/- 0.18 x 
      10(-9) m(2)/s in normal muscle and increased to 1.56 +/- 0.23 x 10(-9) m(2)/s in 
      denervated muscles (p = 0.0016). In animals, EMG and muscle pathological studies 
      were normal 1 day after axotomy, and the muscles demonstrated spontaneous 
      activity on EMG and neurogenic atrophy on histological studies 7 days later. 
      CONCLUSION: This DWMRI study demonstrates that enlargement of extracellular fluid 
      space in muscle denervation is an early phenomenon occurring several days before 
      the appearance of EMG and histological abnormalities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted 
      (DW) MRI for differentiating between benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumours 
      at 3 T. METHODS: 65 patients with treatment-naïve musculoskeletal tumours (47 
      malignant and 23 benign lesions) who underwent 3 T MRI including IVIM DW imaging 
      were included. IVIM-derived parameters included pure diffusion coefficient (D), 
      perfusion related incoherent microcirculation (D*, pseudodiffusion coefficient), 
      and perfusion fraction (f). IVIM parameters and mono-exponential apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) were retrospectively measured by two independent 
      musculoskeletal radiologists. RESULTS: D and ADC values of malignant tumours (923 
      ± 360, 965 ± 353 µm(2) s(-1), respectively) were significantly lower than those 
      of benign tumours (1668 ± 546, 1689 ± 526 µm(2) s(-1)) (p < 0.001). F values of 
      malignant tumours (9.6%) were significantly higher than those of benign tumours 
      (7.2%) (p = 0.021), whereas D* values showed no significant difference (p > 
      0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of D, ADC 
      and f were 0.874, 0.880 and 0.671, respectively. Using cut-off values of D and 
      ADC of 1200 µm(2) s(-1), the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 92, 83, 
      89%, 92, 87 and 90%, respectively. CONCLUSION: D and ADC may be more accurate and 
      reliable for differentiation of malignant from benign musculoskeletal tumours 
      than f and D* at 3 T IVIM DW imaging. Advances in knowledge: Among IVIM-derived 
      parameters, D is more accurate and reliable in differentiating malignant from 
      benign musculoskeletal tumours than f and D* at 3.0T IVIM DW imaging. There was 
      no significant difference in the diagnostic performance of D and ADC.

TI  - Quantitative MRI Differentiates Electromyography Severity Grades of Denervated 
      Muscle in Neuropathy of the Brachial Plexus.
PG  - 1104-1115
LID - 10.1002/jmri.28125 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) metrics reflect microstructural skeletal 
      muscle changes secondary to denervation and may correspond to conventional 
      electromyography (EMG) assessments of motor unit recruitment (MUR) and 
      denervation. HYPOTHESIS: Differences in quantitative T(2) , diffusion-based 
      apparent fiber diameter (AFD), and fat fraction (FF) exist between EMG grades, in 
      patients with clinically suspected neuropathy of the brachial plexus. STUDY TYPE: 
      Prospective. POPULATION: A total of 30 subjects (age = 37.5 ± 17.5, 21M/9F) with 
      suspected brachial plexopathy. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3-Tesla; qMRI using fast 
      spin echo (T(2) -mapping), multi-b-valued diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging 
      (for AFD), and dual-echo Dixon gradient echo (FF-mapping) sequences. ASSESSMENT: 
      qMRI values were compared against EMG grades (MUR and denervation). qMRI values 
      (T(2) , AFD, and FF) were obtained for five regional shoulder muscles. A 4-point 
      scale was used for MUR/denervation severity. STATISTICAL TESTS: Linear mixed 
      models and least-squares pairwise comparisons were used to evaluate qMRI 
      differences between EMG grades. Predictive accuracy of EMG grades from qMRI was 
      quantified by 10-fold cross-validated logistic models. A P value < 0.05 was 
      considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Mean (95% confidence interval) 
      qMRI for "full" MUR were T(2)  = 39.40 msec (35.72-43.08 msec), AFD = 78.35 μm 
      (72.52-84.19 μm), and FF = 4.54% (2.11-6.97%). Significant T(2) increases (+8.36 
      to +14.67 msec) and significant AFD decreases (-11.04 to -21.58 μm) were observed 
      with all abnormal MUR grades as compared to "full" MUR. Significant changes in 
      both T(2) and AFD were observed with increased denervation (+9.59 to +15.04 msec, 
      -16.25 to -18.66 μm). There were significant differences in FF between some MUR 
      grades (-1.45 to +2.96%), but no significant changes were observed with 
      denervation (P = 0.089-0.662). qMRI prediction of abnormal MUR or denervation was 
      strong (mean accuracy = 0.841 and 0.810, respectively) but moderate at predicting 
      individual grades (accuracy = 0.492 and 0.508, respectively). DATA CONCLUSION: 
      Quantitative T(2) and AFD differences were observed between EMG grades in 
      assessing muscle denervation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 1.

PG  - 257-266
LID - 10.1007/s00062-019-00875-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Aim of this study is to compare Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
      (qMRI) measures between Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) and Healthy Subjects (HS) 
      and to correlate these parameters with clinical scores. METHODS: Ten BMD patients 
      (mean age ±standard deviation: 38.7 ± 15.0 years) and ten age-matched HS, were 
      investigated through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at thigh and calf levels, 
      including: 1) a standard axial T1-weighted sequence; 2) a volumetric T2-weighted 
      sequence; 3) a multiecho spin-echo sequence; 4) a 2-point Dixon sequence; 5) a 
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) sequence. RESULTS: Mean Fat Fraction (FF), 
      T2-relaxation time and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) DTI at thigh and calf levels 
      were significantly higher in BMD patients than in HS (p-values < 0.01). FF at 
      thigh and calf levels significantly correlated with North Star Ambulatory 
      Assessment (NSAA) score (p-values < 0.01) and6 Minutes Walking Test (6MWT) 
      (p-values < 0.01), whereas only calf muscle FF was significantly associated with 
      time to get up from floor (p-value = 0.01). T2 significantly correlated with NSAA 
      score (p-value < 0.01), 6MWT (p-value = 0.02) and time to get up from floor 
      (p-value < 0.01) only at calf level. Among DTI values, only FA in thigh and calf 
      muscles significantly correlated with NSAA score, 6MWT and 10-m walk (all 
      p-values < 0.05); only FA in calf muscles significantly correlated with time to 
      get up from floor (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Muscle FF, T2-relaxometry and DTI, 
      seem to be a promising biomarker to assess BMD disease severity, although further 
      studies are needed to evaluate changes over the time.

TI  - Usefulness of texture features of apparent diffusion coefficient maps in 
      predicting chemoradiotherapy response in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
PG  - 671-679
LID - 10.1007/s00330-021-08110-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the usefulness of the texture analysis (TA) of apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in predicting the chemoradiotherapy (CRT) 
      response of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). METHODS: We reviewed 45 MIBC 
      patients who underwent cystectomy after CRT. CRT response was assessed through 
      histologic evaluation of cystectomy specimens. Two radiologists determined the 
      volume of interest for the index lesions on ADC maps of pretherapeutic 1.5-T MRI 
      and performed TA using the LIFEx software. Forty-six texture features (TFs) were 
      selected based on their contribution to the prediction of CRT sensitivity. To 
      evaluate diagnostic performance, diagnostic models from the selected TFs were 
      created using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), respectively. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-three patients achieved pathologic complete response (pCR) to 
      CRT. The feature selection identified first quartile ADC (Q1 ADC), gray-level 
      co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) correlation, and GLCM homogeneity as important in 
      predicting CRT response. Patients who achieved pCR showed significantly lower Q1 
      ADC and GLCM correlation values (0.66 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s and 0.53, respectively) 
      than those who did not (0.81 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s and 0.70, respectively; p < 0.05 
      for both). The AUCs of the RF and SVM models incorporating the selected TFs were 
      0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-0.97) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-1.00), 
      respectively, and the AUC of the SVM model was better than that of the mean ADC 
      value (0.76, 95% CI: 0.61-0.90; p = 0.0037). CONCLUSION: TFs can serve as imaging 
      biomarkers in MIBC patients for predicting CRT sensitivity. TAs of ADC maps can 
      potentially optimize patient selection for CRT. KEY POINTS: • Texture analysis of 
      ADC maps and feature selection identified important texture features for 
      classifying pathologic tumor response in patients with muscle-invasive bladder 
      cancer. • The machine learning model incorporating the texture features set, 
      which included first quartile ADC, GLCM correlation, and GLCM homogeneity, showed 
      high performance in predicting chemoradiotherapy response. • Texture features 
      could serve as imaging biomarkers that optimize eligible patient selection for 
      chemoradiotherapy in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prospectively compare the diagnostic efficacy of conventional 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in 
      differentiating between muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and 
      non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). METHODS: Multiple b value DWIs were 
      performed using a 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging unit in fifty-one patients 
      with bladder cancer including MIBC and NMIBC confirmed by histopathological 
      findings. DWI data were postprocessed using mono-exponential and DKI models to 
      calculate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), apparent diffusional kurtosis 
      (K(app)), and kurtosis-corrected diffusion coefficient (D(app)). 
      Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare the 
      diagnostic efficacy of all diffusion parameters. RESULTS: All parameters differed 
      significantly between MIBC and NIMBC including increased K(app), decreased D(app) 
      and ADC (all p < 0.001). Only the combination of D(app) and K(app) was 
      significantly higher than ADC (p < 0.05), whilst D(app) and K(app) were not 
      statistically different from ADC. CONCLUSIONS: Both conventional DWI and DKI 
      models are beneficial in differentiating between MIBC and NMIBC, whilst the 
      combination of D(app) and K(app) can produce a more robust value than 
      conventional ADC value in evaluating aggressiveness of bladder cancer.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate temporal stability, multi-center 
      reproducibility and the influence of covariates on a multimodal MR protocol for 
      quantitative muscle imaging and to facilitate its use as a standardized protocol 
      for evaluation of pathology in skeletal muscle. Quantitative T2, quantitative 
      diffusion and four-point Dixon acquisitions of the calf muscles of both legs were 
      repeated within one hour. Sixty-five healthy volunteers (31 females) were 
      included in one of eight 3-T MR systems. Five traveling subjects were examined in 
      six MR scanners. Average values over all slices of water-T2 relaxation time, 
      proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and diffusion metrics were determined for 
      seven muscles. Temporal stability was tested with repeated measured ANOVA and 
      two-way random intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Multi-center 
      reproducibility of traveling volunteers was assessed by a two-way mixed ICC. The 
      factors age, body mass index, gender and muscle were tested for covariance. ICCs 
      of temporal stability were between 0.963 and 0.999 for all parameters. Water-T2 
      relaxation decreased significantly (P < 10(-3) ) within one hour by ~ 1 ms. 
      Multi-center reproducibility showed ICCs within 0.879-0.917 with the lowest ICC 
      for mean diffusivity. Different muscles showed the highest covariance, explaining 
      20-40% of variance for observed parameters. Standardized acquisition and 
      processing of quantitative muscle MRI data resulted in high comparability among 
      centers. The imaging protocol exhibited high temporal stability over one hour 
      except for water T2 relaxation times. These results show that data pooling is 
      feasible and enables assembling data from patients with neuromuscular diseases, 
      paving the way towards larger studies of rare muscle disorders.

TI  - A novel diffusion-tensor MRI approach for skeletal muscle fascicle length 
      measurements.
LID - 10.14814/phy2.13012 [doi]
LID - e13012
AB  - Musculoskeletal (dys-)function relies for a large part on muscle architecture 
      which can be obtained using Diffusion-Tensor MRI (DT-MRI) and fiber tractography. 
      However, reconstructed tracts often continue along the tendon or aponeurosis when 
      using conventional methods, thus overestimating fascicle lengths. In this study, 
      we propose a new method for semiautomatic segmentation of tendinous tissue using 
      tract density (TD). We investigated the feasibility and repeatability of this 
      method to quantify the mean fascicle length per muscle. Additionally, we examined 
      whether the method facilitates measuring changes in fascicle length of lower leg 
      muscles with different foot positions. Five healthy subjects underwent two DT-MRI 
      scans of the right lower leg, with the foot in 15° dorsiflexion, neutral, and 30° 
      plantarflexion positions. Repeatability of fascicle length measurements was 
      assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. Changes in fascicle lengths between the 
      foot positions were tested using a repeated multivariate analysis of variance 
      (MANOVA). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between repeated 
      measurements. The coefficients of variation in neutral position were 8.3, 16.7, 
      11.2, and 10.4% for soleus (SOL), fibularis longus (FL), extensor digitorum 
      longus (EDL), and tibialis anterior (TA), respectively. The plantarflexors (SOL 
      and FL) showed significant increase in fascicle length from plantarflexion to 
      dorsiflexion, whereas the dorsiflexors (EDL and TA) exhibited a significant 
      decrease. The use of a tract density for semiautomatic segmentation of tendinous 
      structures provides more accurate estimates of the mean fascicle length than 
      traditional fiber tractography methods. The method shows moderate to good 
      repeatability and allows for quantification of changes in fascicle lengths due to 
      passive stretch.

TI  - Repeatability of chemical-shift-encoded water-fat MRI and diffusion-tensor 
      imaging in lower extremity muscles in children.
PG  - W567-73

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the repeatability of water-fat 
      MRI and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) as quantitative biomarkers of pediatric 
      lower extremity skeletal muscle. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: MRI at 3 T of a randomly 
      selected thigh and lower leg of seven healthy children was studied using 
      water-fat separation and DTI techniques. Muscle-fat fraction, apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were calculated. 
      Test-retest and interrater repeatability were assessed by calculating the Pearson 
      correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman 
      analysis. RESULTS: Bland-Altman plots show that the mean difference between 
      test-retest and interrater measurements of muscle-fat fraction, ADC, and FA was 
      near 0. The correlation coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients were 
      all between 0.88 and 0.99 (p < 0.05), suggesting excellent reliability of the 
      measurements. Muscle-fat fraction measurements from water-fat MRI exhibited the 
      highest intraclass correlation coefficient. Interrater agreement was consistently 
      better than test-retest comparisons. CONCLUSION: Water-fat MRI and DTI 
      measurements in lower extremity skeletal muscles are objective repeatable 
      biomarkers in children. This knowledge should aid in the understanding of the 
      number of participants needed in clinical trials when using these determinations 
      as an outcome measure to noninvasively monitor neuromuscular disease.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted MRI with intravoxel incoherent motion modeling for assessment 
      of muscle perfusion in the thigh during post-exercise hyperemia in younger and 
      older adults.
PG  - e4072
LID - 10.1002/nbm.4072 [doi]
AB  - Aging is associated with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation that leads 
      to muscle perfusion impairment and contributes to organ dysfunction. Impaired 
      muscle perfusion may result in inadequate delivery of oxygen and nutrients during 
      and after muscle contraction, leading to muscle damage. The ability to study the 
      relationship between perfusion and muscle damage has been limited using 
      traditional muscle perfusion measures, which are invasive and risky. To overcome 
      this limitation, we optimized a diffusion-weighted MRI sequence and validated an 
      intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation to 
      study muscle perfusion impairment with aging during post-exercise hyperemia. 
      Simulation results demonstrated that the bias of IVIM-derived perfusion fraction 
      (f(p) ) and diffusion of water molecules in extra-vascular tissue (D) ranged from 
      -3.3% to 14% and from -16.5% to 0.002%, respectively, in the optimized 
      experimental condition. The dispersion in f(p) and D ranged from 3.2% to 9.5% and 
      from 0.9% to 1.1%, respectively. The mid-thigh of the left leg of four younger 
      (21-30 year old) and four older (60-90 year old) healthy females was studied 
      using the optimized protocol at baseline and at seven time increments occurring 
      every 3.25 min following in-magnet dynamic knee extension exercise performed 
      using a MR-compatible ergometer with a workload of 0.4 bar for 2.5 min. After 
      exercise, both f(p) and D significantly increased in the rectus femoris (active 
      muscle during exercise) but not in adductor magnus (inactive muscle), reflecting 
      the fact that the local increase in perfusion with both groups showed a maximum 
      value in the second post-exercise time-point. A significantly greater increase in 
      perfusion from the baseline (p < 0.05) was observed in the younger group 
      (37 ± 12.05%) compared with the older group (17.57 ± 15.92%) at the first 
      post-exercise measurement. This work establishes a reliable non-invasive method 
      that can be used to study the effects of aging on dynamic changes in muscle 
      perfusion as they relate to important measures of physical function.

TI  - Quantitative Identification of Nonmuscle-Invasive and Muscle-Invasive Bladder 
      Carcinomas: A Multiparametric MRI Radiomics Analysis.
PG  - 1489-1498
LID - 10.1002/jmri.26327 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative discrimination between nonmuscle-invasive bladder 
      carcinomas (NMIBC) and the muscle-invasive ones (MIBC) is very crucial in the 
      management of patients with bladder cancer (BC). PURPOSE: To evaluate the 
      discriminative performance of multiparametric MRI radiomics features for precise 
      differentiation of NMIBC from MIBC, preoperatively. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective, 
      radiomics. POPULATION: Fifty-four patients with postoperative pathologically 
      proven BC lesions (24 in NMIBC and 30 in MIBC groups) were included. FIELD 
      STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T MRI/T(2) -weighted (T(2) W) and multi-b-value 
      diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences. ASSESSMENT: A total of 1104 radiomics features 
      were extracted from carcinomatous regions of interest on T(2) W and DW images, 
      and the apparent diffusion coefficient maps. Support vector machine with 
      recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and synthetic minority oversampling 
      technique (SMOTE) were used to construct an optimal discriminative model, and its 
      performance was evaluated and compared with that of using visual diagnoses by 
      experts. STATISTICAL TESTS: Chi-square test and Student's t-test were applied on 
      clinical characteristics to analyze the significant differences between patient 
      groups. RESULTS: Of the 1104 features, an optimal subset involving 19 features 
      was selected from T(2) W and DW sequences, which outperformed the other two 
      subsets selected from T(2) W or DW sequence in muscle invasion discrimination. 
      The best performance for the differentiation task was achieved by the 
      SVM-RFE+SMOTE classifier, with averaged sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and 
      area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic of 92.60%, 100%, 
      96.30%, and 0.9857, respectively, which outperformed the diagnostic accuracy by 
      experts. DATA CONCLUSION: The proposed radiomics approach has potential for the 
      accurate differentiation of muscle invasion in BC, preoperatively. The optimal 
      feature subset selected from multiparametric MR images demonstrated better 
      performance in identifying muscle invasiveness when compared with that from T(2) 
      W sequence or DW sequence only. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2

TI  - Relationships between tissue microstructure and the diffusion tensor in simulated 
      skeletal muscle.
PG  - 317-329
LID - 10.1002/mrm.26993 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish a series of relationships defining how muscle 
      microstructure and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are related. METHODS: The 
      relationship among key microstructural features of skeletal muscle (fiber size, 
      fibrosis, edema, and permeability) and the diffusion tensor were systematically 
      simulated over physiologically relevant dimensions individually, and in 
      combination, using a numerical simulation application. Stepwise multiple 
      regression was used to identify which microstructural features of muscle 
      significantly predict the diffusion tensor using single-echo and multi-echo DTI 
      pulse sequences. Simulations were also performed in models with 
      histology-informed geometry to investigate the relationship between fiber size 
      and the diffusion tensor in models with real muscle geometry. RESULTS: Fiber size 
      is the strongest predictor of λ2, λ3, mean diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy 
      in skeletal muscle, accounting for approximately 40% of the variance in the 
      diffusion model when calculated with single-echo DTI. This increased to 
      approximately 70% when diffusion measures were calculated from the short T(2) 
      component of the multi-echo DTI sequence. This nonlinear relationship begins to 
      plateau in fibers with greater than 60-μm diameter. CONCLUSIONS: As the normal 
      fiber size of a human muscle fiber is 40 to 60 μm, this suggests that DTI is a 
      sensitive tool to monitor muscle atrophy, but may be limited in measurements of 
      muscle with larger fibers. Magn Reson Med 80:317-329, 2018. © 2017 International

TI  - Evaluation of interrater reliability of different muscle segmentation techniques 
      in diffusion tensor imaging.
PG  - e4430
LID - 10.1002/nbm.4430 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Muscle diffusion tensor imaging (mDTI) is a quantitative MRI 
      technique that can provide information about muscular microstructure and 
      integrity. Ultrasound and DTI studies have shown intramuscular differences, and 
      therefore separation of different muscles for analysis is essential. The commonly 
      used methods to assess DTI metrics in muscles are manual segmentation and 
      tract-based analysis. Recently methods such as volume-based tractography have 
      been applied to optimize muscle architecture estimation, but can also be used to 
      assess DTI metrics. PURPOSE: To evaluate diffusion metrics obtained using three 
      different methods-volume-based tractography, manual segmentation-based analysis 
      and tract-based analysis-with respect to their interrater reliability and their 
      ability to detect intramuscular variance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 30 volunteers 
      underwent an MRI examination in a 3 T scanner using a 16-channel Torso XL coil. 
      Diffusion-weighted images were acquired to obtain DTI metrics. These metrics were 
      evaluated in six thigh muscles using volume-based tractography, manual 
      segmentation and standard tractography. All three methods were performed by two 
      independent raters to assess interrater reliability by ICC analysis and 
      Bland-Altman plots. Ability to assess intramuscular variance was compared using 
      an ANOVA with muscle as a between-subjects factor. RESULTS: Interrater 
      reliability for all methods was found to be excellent. The highest interrater 
      reliability was found for volume-based tractography (ICC ≥ 0.967). Significant 
      differences for the factor muscle in all examined diffusion parameters were shown 
      in muscles using all methods (main effect p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion data 
      can be assessed by volume tractography, standard tractography and manual 
      segmentation with high interrater reliability. Each method produces different 
      results for the investigated DTI parameters. Volume-based tractography was 
      superior to conventional manual segmentation and tractography regarding 
      interrater reliability and detection of intramuscular variance, while tract-based 
      analysis showed the lowest coefficients of variation.

TI  - Quantitative MRI Reveals Microstructural Changes in the Upper Leg Muscles After 
      Running a Marathon.
PG  - 407-417
LID - 10.1002/jmri.27106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of sports-related injuries involve skeletal muscle. 
      Unlike acute trauma, which is often caused by a single traumatic event leading to 
      acute symptoms, exercise-induced microtrauma may remain subclinical and difficult 
      to detect. Therefore, novel methods to detect and localize subclinical 
      exercise-induced muscle microtrauma are desirable. PURPOSE: To assess acute and 
      delayed microstructural changes in upper leg muscles with multiparametric 
      quantitative MRI after running a marathon. STUDY TYPE: Longitudinal; 1-week 
      prior, 24-48 hours postmarathon and 2-week follow-up POPULATION: Eleven men 
      participants (age: 47-68 years). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Spin-echo echo planar 
      imaging (SE-EPI) with diffusion weighting, multispin echo, Dixon, and 
      fat-suppressed turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences at 3T. MR datasets and creatine 
      kinase (CK) concentrations were obtained at three timepoints. ASSESSMENT: 
      Diffusion parameters, perfusion fractions, and quantitative (q)T(2) values were 
      determined for hamstring and quadriceps muscles, TSE images were scored for acute 
      injury. The vastus medialis and biceps femoris long head muscles were divided and 
      analyzed in five segments to assess local damage. STATISTICAL TESTS: Differences 
      between timepoints in MR parameters were assessed with a multilevel linear mixed 
      model and in CK concentrations with a Friedman test. Mean diffusivity (MD) and 
      qT(2) for whole muscle and muscle segments were compared using a multivariate 
      analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). RESULTS: CK concentrations were elevated 
      (1194 U/L [166-3906], P < 0.001) at 24-48 hours postmarathon and returned to 
      premarathon values (323 U/L [56-2216]) at 2-week follow-up. Most of the MRI 
      diffusion indices in muscles without acute injury changed at 24-48 hours 
      postmarathon and returned to premarathon values at follow-up (MD, RD, and λ3; 
      P < 0.006). qT(2) values (P = 0.003) and perfusion fractions (P = 0.003) were 
      higher at baseline compared to follow-up. Local assessments of MD and qT(2) 
      revealed more pronounced changes than whole muscle assessment (2-3-fold; 
      P < 0.01). DATA CONCLUSION: Marathon running-induced microtrauma was detected 
      with MRI in individual whole upper leg muscles and even more pronounced on local 
      segments. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 3 J. Magn. Reson.

TI  - White matter microstructure in Parkinson's disease with and without elevated 
      rapid eye movement sleep muscle tone.
PG  - fcac027
LID - 10.1093/braincomms/fcac027 [doi]
LID - fcac027
AB  - People with Parkinson's disease who have elevated muscle activity during rapid 
      eye movement sleep (REM sleep without atonia) typically have a worse motor and 
      cognitive impairment compared with those with normal muscle atonia during rapid 
      eye movement sleep. This study used tract-based spatial statistics to compare 
      diffusion MRI measures of fractional anisotropy, radial, mean and axial 
      diffusivity (measures of axonal microstructure based on the directionality of 
      water diffusion) in white matter tracts between people with Parkinson's disease 
      with and without rapid eye movement sleep without atonia and controls and their 
      relationship to measures of motor and cognitive function. Thirty-eight 
      individuals with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease and 21 matched control 
      subjects underwent ultra-high field MRI (7 T), quantitative motor assessments of 
      gait and bradykinesia and neuropsychological testing. The Parkinson's disease 
      cohort was separated post hoc into those with and without elevated chin or leg 
      muscle activity during rapid eye movement sleep based on polysomnography 
      findings. Fractional anisotropy was significantly higher, and diffusivity 
      significantly lower, in regions of the corpus callosum, projection and 
      association white matter pathways in the Parkinson's group with normal rapid eye 
      movement sleep muscle tone compared with controls, and in a subset of pathways 
      relative to the Parkinson's disease group with rapid eye movement sleep without 
      atonia. The Parkinson's disease group with elevated rapid eye movement sleep 
      muscle tone showed significant impairments in the gait and upper arm speed 
      compared with controls and significantly worse scores in specific cognitive 
      domains (executive function, visuospatial memory) compared with the Parkinson's 
      disease group with normal rapid eye movement sleep muscle tone. Regression 
      analyses showed that gait speed and step length in the Parkinson's disease cohort 
      were predicted by measures of fractional anisotropy of the anterior corona 
      radiata, whereas elbow flexion velocity was predicted by fractional anisotropy of 
      the superior corona radiata. Visuospatial memory task performance was predicted 
      by the radial diffusivity of the posterior corona radiata. These findings show 
      that people with mild-to-moderate severity of Parkinson's disease who have normal 
      muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep demonstrate compensatory-like 
      adaptations in axonal microstructure that are associated with preserved motor and 
      cognitive function, but these adaptations are reduced or absent in those with 
      increased rapid eye movement sleep motor tone.

LID - 10.1002/jmri.22668 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the effects of strenuous exercise on magnetic resonance 
      diffusion parameters and muscle-tendon complex function in skeletal muscle. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six men performed ankle plantar flexion exercises with 
      eccentric contraction. The fractional anisotropy (FA), λ(1) , λ(2) , λ(3) , mean 
      diffusivity (MD), and T(2) values in the triceps surae muscles were measured by 
      magnetic resonance diffusion tensor and spin-echo imaging. Passive torque of 
      plantar flexors, maximal voluntary isometric plantar flexion torques (MVIP), and 
      Achilles tendon stiffness during MVIP were measured by combined ultrasonography 
      and dynamometry. Plasma creatine kinase and muscle soreness were also assessed. 
      These parameters were measured before and 1-8 days postexercise. RESULTS: The 
      medial gastrocnemius exhibited significantly decreased FA 2-5 days after, 
      increased λ(2) 3 days after, and increased λ(3) 2 and 3 days after exercise. This 
      muscle also showed significantly increased MD and T(2) values 3 days 
      postexercise. MVIP significantly decreased 2 and 3 days postexercise, while 
      passive torque significantly increased 2 days postexercise. Creatine kinase and 
      muscle soreness increased 3-5 days and 1-5 days postexercise, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: Exercise-induced muscle damage manifested as significant changes in 
      muscle diffusion parameters with muscle-tendon complex dysfunction and 
      delayed-onset muscle soreness.

TI  - Clinical utility of the Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System for 
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer between radiologists and urologists based on 
      multiparametric MRI including 3D FSE T2-weighted acquisitions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical utility of the Vesical Imaging-Reporting 
      and Data System (VI-RADS) by comparing its diagnostic performance for 
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) between radiologists and urologists based 
      on multiparametric MRI, including three-dimensional (3D) fast spin-echo (FSE) 
      T2-weighted acquisitions. METHODS: This study included 66 treatment-naïve 
      patients (60 men, 6 women; mean age 74.0 years) with pathologically proven 
      bladder cancer who underwent multiparametric MRI, including 3D FSE T2-weighted 
      imaging, before transurethral bladder tumour resection between January 2010 and 
      November 2018. The MRI scans were categorised according to the five-point VI-RADS 
      score by four independent readers (two board-certified radiologists and 
      board-certified urologists each), blinded to the histopathological findings. The 
      VI-RADS scores were compared with the postoperative histopathological diagnosis. 
      Interobserver agreement was assessed using weighted kappa coefficients. ROC 
      analysis and generalised estimating equations were used to evaluate the 
      diagnostic performance. RESULTS: Forty-nine (74.2%) and 17 (25.8%) tumours were 
      confirmed to be non-MIBC and MIBC, respectively, based on pathological 
      examination. The interobserver agreement was good-to-excellent between all pairs 
      of readers (range, 0.73-0.91). The urologists' sensitivity/specificity values for 
      DCE-MRI VI-RADS scores were significantly lower than those of radiologists. No 
      significant differences were observed for the overall VI-RADS score. The AUC for 
      the overall VI-RADS score was 0.94, 0.92, 0.89, and 0.87 for radiologists 1 and 2 
      and urologists 1 and 2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The VI-RADS score, based on 
      multiparametric MRI including 3D FSE T2-weighted acquisitions, can be useful for 
      radiologists and urologists to determine the bladder cancer muscle invasion 
      status preoperatively. KEY POINTS: • VI-RADS (using multiparametric MRI including 
      3D FSE T2-weighted acquisitions) achieves good to excellent interobserver 
      agreement and has similar diagnostic performance for detecting muscle invasion by 
      both radiologists and urologists. • The diagnostic performance of the overall 
      VI-RADS score is high for both radiologists and urologists, particularly due to 
      the dominant effect of diffusion-weighted imaging on the overall VI-RADS score. • 
      The sensitivity and specificity values of the T2WI VI-RADS scores for four 
      readers in our study (using 3D FSE T2-weighted acquisitions) were similar (with 
      slightly higher specificity values) to previously published results (using 2D FSE 
      T2-weighted acquisitions).

PG  - 3661-3673
LID - 10.1044/2022_JSLHR-22-00040 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this study is to validate the muscle architecture derived 
      from both ex vivo and in vivo diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging 
      (dMRI) of the human tongue with histology of an ex vivo tongue. METHOD: dMRI was 
      acquired with a 200-direction high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) 
      diffusion scheme for both a postmortem head (imaged within 48 hr after death) and 
      a healthy volunteer. After MRI, the postmortem head was fixed and the tongue 
      excised for hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and histology imaging. 
      Structure tensor images were generated from the stained images to better 
      demonstrate muscle fiber orientations. The tongue muscle fiber orientations, 
      estimated from dMRI, were visualized using the tractogram, a novel representation 
      of crossing fiber orientations, and compared against the histology images of the 
      ex vivo tongue. RESULTS: Muscle fibers identified in the tractograms showed good 
      correspondence with those appearing in the histology images. We further 
      demonstrated tongue muscle architecture in in vivo tractograms for the entire 
      tongue. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that dMRI can accurately reveal the 
      complex muscle architecture of the human tongue and may potentially benefit 
      planning and evaluation of oral surgery and research on speech and swallowing.

AB  - Muscle fiber direction strain provides invaluable information for characterizing 
      muscle function. However, methods to study this for human muscles in vivo are 
      lacking. Using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging based deformation analyses and 
      diffusion tensor (DT) imaging based tractography combined, we aimed to assess 
      muscle fiber direction local tissue deformations within the human medial 
      gastrocnemius (GM) muscle. Healthy female subjects (n=5, age=27±1 years) were 
      positioned prone within the MR scanner in a relaxed state with the ankle angle 
      fixed at 90°. The knee was brought to flexion (140.8±3.0°) (undeformed state). 
      Sets of 3D high resolution MR, and DT images were acquired. This protocol was 
      repeated at extended knee joint position (177.0±1.0°) (deformed state). 
      Tractography and Demons nonrigid registration algorithm was utilized to calculate 
      local deformations along muscle fascicles. Undeformed state images were also 
      transformed by a synthetic rigid body motion to calculate strain errors. Mean 
      strain errors were significantly smaller then mean fiber direction strains 
      (lengthening: 0.2±0.1% vs. 8.7±8.5%; shortening: 3.3±0.9% vs. 7.5±4.6%). 
      Shortening and lengthening (up to 23.3% and 116.7%, respectively) occurs 
      simultaneously along individual fascicles despite imposed GM lengthening. 
      Along-fiber shear strains confirm the presence of much shearing between 
      fascicles. Mean fiber direction strains of different tracts also show non-uniform 
      distribution. Inhomogeneity of fiber strain indicates epimuscular myofascial 
      force transmission. We conclude that MR and DT imaging analyses combined provide 
      a powerful tool for quantifying deformation along human muscle fibers in vivo. 
      This can help substantially achieving a better understanding of normal and 
      pathological muscle function and mechanisms of treatment techniques.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic tool that can be used to 
      noninvasively assess lumbar muscle size and fatty infiltration, important 
      biomarkers of muscle health. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique 
      that is sensitive to muscle microstructural features such as fiber size (an 
      important biomarker of muscle health), which is typically only assessed using 
      invasive biopsy techniques. The goal of this study was to establish normative 
      values of level-dependent lumbar muscle size, fat signal fraction, and restricted 
      diffusion assessed by MRI in a highly active population. Forty-two active-duty 
      Marines were imaged using a (a) high-resolution anatomical, (b) fat-water 
      separation, and (c) DT-MRI scan. The multifidus and erector spinae muscles were 
      compared at each level using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Secondary analysis 
      included Three dimensional (3D) reconstructions to qualitatively assess lumbar 
      muscle size, fatty infiltration, and fiber orientation via tractography. The 
      erector spinae was found to be larger than the multifidus above L5, with lower 
      fat signal fraction above L3, and a less restricted diffusion profile than the 
      multifidus above L4, with this pattern reversed in the lower lumbar spine. 3D 
      reconstructions demonstrated accumulations of epimuscular fat in the anterior and 
      posterior regions of the lumbar musculature, with minimal intramuscular fatty 
      infiltration. Tractography images demonstrated different orientations of adjacent 
      lumbar musculature, which cannot be visualized with standard MRI pulse sequences. 
      The level dependent differences found in this study provide a normative baseline, 
      for which to better understand whole muscle and microstructural changes 
      associated with aging, low back pain, and pathology.

TI  - MRI assessment of the thigh musculature in dermatomyositis and healthy subjects 
      using diffusion tensor imaging, intravoxel incoherent motion and dynamic DTI.
PG  - 5304-5315

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy 
      involving severe debilitation in need of diagnostics. We evaluated the proximal 
      lower extremity musculature with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), intravoxel 
      incoherent motion (IVIM) and dynamic DTI in DM patients and controls and compared 
      with standard clinical workup.  METHODS: In this IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant 
      study with written informed consent, anatomical, Dixon fat/water and diffusion 
      imaging were collected in bilateral thigh MRI of 22 controls and 27 DM patients 
      in a 3T scanner. Compartments were scored on T1/T2 scales. Single voxel dynamic 
      DTI metrics in quadriceps before and after 3-min leg exercise were measured. 
      Spearman rank correlation and mixed model analysis of variance/covariance 
      (ANOVA/ANCOVA) were used to correlate with T1 and T2 scores and to compare 
      patients with controls. RESULTS: DM patients showed significantly lower 
      pseudo-diffusion and volume in quadriceps than controls. All subjects showed 
      significant correlation between T1 score and signal-weighted fat fraction; tissue 
      diffusion and pseudo-diffusion varied significantly with T1 and T2 score in 
      patients. Radial and mean diffusion exercise response in patients was 
      significantly higher than controls. CONCLUSION: Static and dynamic diffusion 
      imaging metrics show correlation with conventional imaging scores, reveal spatial 
      heterogeneity, and provide means to differentiate dermatomyositis patients from 
      controls. KEY POINTS: • Diffusion imaging shows regional differences between 
      thigh muscles of dermatomyositis patients and controls. • Signal-weighted fat 
      fraction and diffusion metrics correlate with T1/T2 scores of disease severity. • 
      Dermatomyositis patients show significantly higher radial diffusion exercise 
      response than controls.

TI  - Pilot Study on Quantitative Cervical Cord and Muscular MRI in Spinal Muscular 
      Atrophy: Promising Biomarkers of Disease Evolution and Treatment?
PG  - 613834
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2021.613834 [doi]

AB  - Introduction: Nusinersen is a recent promising therapy approved for the treatment 
      of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare disease characterized by the 
      degeneration of alpha motor neurons (αMN) in the spinal cord (SC) leading to 
      progressive muscle atrophy and dysfunction. Muscle and cervical SC quantitative 
      magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) has never been used to monitor drug treatment 
      in SMA. The aim of this pilot study is to investigate whether qMRI can provide 
      useful biomarkers for monitoring treatment efficacy in SMA. Methods: Three adult 
      SMA 3a patients under treatment with nusinersen underwent longitudinal clinical 
      and qMRI examinations every 4 months from baseline to 21-month follow-up. The 
      qMRI protocol aimed to quantify thigh muscle fat fraction (FF) and water-T2 
      (w-T2) and to characterize SC volumes and microstructure. Eleven healthy controls 
      underwent the same SC protocol (single time point). We evaluated clinical and 
      imaging outcomes of SMA patients longitudinally and compared SC data between 
      groups transversally. Results: Patient motor function was stable, with only 
      Patient 2 showing moderate improvements. Average muscle FF was already high at 
      baseline (50%) and progressed over time (57%). w-T2 was also slightly higher than 
      previously published data at baseline and slightly decreased over time. 
      Cross-sectional area of the whole SC, gray matter (GM), and ventral horns (VHs) 
      of Patients 1 and 3 were reduced compared to controls and remained stable over 
      time, while GM and VHs areas of Patient 2 slightly increased. We found altered 
      diffusion and magnetization transfer parameters in SC structures of SMA patients 
      compared to controls, thus suggesting changes in tissue microstructure and myelin 
      content. Conclusion: In this pilot study, we found a progression of FF in thigh 
      muscles of SMA 3a patients during nusinersen therapy and a concurrent slight 
      reduction of w-T2 over time. The SC qMRI analysis confirmed previous imaging and 
      histopathological studies suggesting degeneration of αMN of the VHs, resulting in 
      GM atrophy and demyelination. Our longitudinal data suggest that qMRI could 
      represent a feasible technique for capturing microstructural changes induced by 
      SMA in vivo and a candidate methodology for monitoring the effects of treatment, 
      once replicated on a larger cohort.

TI  - Spontaneous mechanical and electrical activities of human calf musculature at 
      rest assessed by repetitive single-shot diffusion-weighted MRI and simultaneous 
      surface electromyography.
PG  - 2784-2794
LID - 10.1002/mrm.26921 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Assessment of temporal and spatial relations between spontaneous 
      mechanical activities in musculature (SMAM) at rest as revealed by 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and electrical muscular activities in surface 
      EMG (sEMG). Potential influences of static and radiofrequency magnetic fields on 
      muscular activity on sEMG measurements at rest were examined systematically. 
      METHODS: Series of diffusion-weighted stimulated echo planar imaging were 
      recorded with concurrent sEMG measurements. Electrical activities in sEMG were 
      analyzed by non-parametric Friedman and two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
      Direct correlation of both modalities was investigated by temporal mapping of 
      electrical activity in sEMG to DWI repetition interval. RESULTS: Electrical 
      activities in sEMG and number of visible SMAMs in DWI showed a strong correlation 
      (ρ = 0.9718). High accordance between sEMG activities and visible SMAMs in DWI in 
      a near-surface region around sEMG electrodes was achieved. Characteristics of 
      sEMG activities were almost similar under varying magnetic field conditions. 
      CONCLUSION: Visible SMAMs in DWI have shown a close and direct relation to 
      concurrent signals recorded by sEMG. MR-related magnetic fields had no 
      significant effects on findings in sEMG. Hence, appearance of SMAMs in DWI should 
      not be considered as imaging artifact or as effects originating from the special 
      conditions of MR examinations. Spatial and temporal distributions of SMAMs 
      indicate characteristics of spontaneous (microscopic) mechanical muscular action 
      at rest. Therefore, DWI techniques should be considered as non-invasive tools for 
      studying physiology and pathophysiology of spontaneous activities in resting 
      muscle. Magn Reson Med 79:2784-2794, 2018. © 2017 International Society for

TI  - Diffusion Properties and 3D Architecture of Human Lower Leg Muscles Assessed with 
      Ultra-High-Field-Strength Diffusion-Tensor MR Imaging and Tractography: 
      Reproducibility and Sensitivity to Sex Difference and Intramuscular Variability.
PG  - 592-607
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2017171330 [doi]
AB  - Purpose To demonstrate the reproducibility of the diffusion properties and 
      three-dimensional structural organization measurements of the lower leg muscles 
      by using diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) assessed with ultra-high-field-strength 
      (7.0-T) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and tractography of skeletal muscle 
      fibers. On the basis of robust statistical mapping analyses, this study also 
      aimed at determining the sensitivity of the measurements to sex difference and 
      intramuscular variability. Materials and Methods All examinations were performed 
      with ethical review board approval; written informed consent was obtained from 
      all volunteers. Reproducibility of diffusion tensor indexes assessment including 
      eigenvalues, mean diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy (FA) as well as muscle 
      volume and architecture (ie, fiber length and pennation angle) were characterized 
      in lower leg muscles (n = 8). Intramuscular variability and sex differences were 
      characterized in young healthy men and women (n = 10 in each group). Student t 
      test, statistical parametric mapping, correlation coefficients (Spearman rho and 
      Pearson product-moment) and coefficient of variation (CV) were used for 
      statistical data analysis. Results High reproducibility of measurements (mean CV 
      ± standard deviation, 4.6% ± 3.8) was determined in diffusion properties and 
      architectural parameters. Significant sex differences were detected in FA (4.2% 
      in women for the entire lower leg; P = .001) and muscle volume (21.7% in men for 
      the entire lower leg; P = .008), whereas architecture parameters were almost 
      identical across sex. Additional differences were found independently of sex in 
      diffusion properties and architecture along several muscles of the lower leg. 
      Conclusion The high-spatial-resolution DTI assessed with 7.0-T MR imaging allows 
      a reproducible assessment of structural organization of superficial and deep 
      muscles, giving indirect information on muscle function. (©)RSNA, 2018 Online

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) 
      parameters and tumor contact length (TCL) among clinical and radiological factors 
      for preoperative prediction of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). METHOD: A 
      total of ninety-seven patients underwent 3.0 T MRI scan with propeller fast 
      spin-echo T2WI, echo planar imaging diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic 
      contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE). Two radiologists independently viewed 
      multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of each patient, graded the VI-RADS, drew the region 
      of interest (ROI) and measured TCL. Interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), 
      Kappa statistics, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney U tests, chi-square 
      tests, logistic regression analyses, Hosmer-Lemeshow tests, receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, and area under the curve (AUC) were applied. 
      RESULTS: The mean K(app) of NMIBC group (0.62 ± 0.01) was significantly lower 
      than that of MIBC group (0.79 ± 0.08). The mean TCL of MIBC group (4.66 ± 1.89) 
      was significantly larger than TCL of NMIBC group (1.88 ± 1.50) (all p < 0.01). At 
      the corresponding cut-off, AUC of TCL, K(app), VI-RADS and the combination of 
      K(app) and TCL were 0.87, 0.92, 0.90, and 0.95, respectively. TCL and K(app) were 
      risk factors of BC muscle invasion at both univariate and multivariate analysis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: K(app) performed better than conventional DWI in predicting MIBC. 
      K(app) and TCL were independent risk factors of MIBC and could complement VI-RADS 
      for predicting muscle invasion. The combination of K(app) and TCL had the largest 
      AUC and highest accuracy among all parameters.

TI  - Diffusion-Tensor MRI Based Skeletal Muscle Fiber Tracking.
PG  - 675-687
AB  - A skeletal muscle's function is strongly influenced by the internal organization 
      and geometric properties of its fibers, a property known as muscle architecture. 
      Diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging-based fiber tracking provides a 
      powerful tool for non-invasive muscle architecture studies, has three-dimensional 
      sensitivity, and uses a fixed frame of reference. Significant advances have been 
      made in muscle fiber tracking technology, including defining seed points for 
      fiber tracking, quantitatively characterizing muscle architecture, implementing 
      denoising procedures, and testing validity and repeatability. Some examples exist 
      of how these data can be integrated with those from other advanced MRI and 
      computational methods to provide novel insights into muscle function. 
      Perspectives are offered regarding future directions in muscle diffusion-tensor 
      imaging, including needs to develop an improved understanding for the 
      microstructural basis for reduced and anisotropic diffusion, establish the best 
      practices for data acquisition and analysis, and integrate fiber tracking with 
      other physiological data.

TI  - Proton diffusion tensor spectroscopy of metabolites in human muscle in vivo.
PG  - 481-7
LID - 10.1002/mrm.25139 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the apparent diffusivity and its directionality for metabolites 
      of skeletal muscle in humans in vivo by (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. 
      METHODS: The diffusion tensors were determined on a 3 Tesla MR system using 
      optimized acquisition and processing methods including an adapted STEAM sequence 
      with orientation-dependent diffusion weighting, pulse-triggering with 
      individually adapted delays, eddy-current correction schemes, median filtering, 
      and simultaneous prior-knowledge fitting of all related spectra. RESULTS: The 
      average apparent diffusivities, as well as the fractional anisotropies of taurine 
      (ADCav=0.74 × 10(-3) s/mm(2) , FA=0.46), creatine (ADCav =0.41 × 10(-3) s/mm(2) , 
      FA=0.33), trimethylammonium compounds (ADCav =0.48 × 10(-3) s/mm(2) , FA=0.34), 
      carnosine (ADCav =0.46 × 10(-3) s/mm(2) , FA=0.47), and water (ADCav=1.5 × 10(-3) 
      s/mm(2) , FA=0.36) were estimated. The diffusivities of most metabolites and 
      water were significantly different from each other. Diffusion was found to be 
      anisotropic and the diffusion tensors showed tensor correlation coefficients 
      close to 1 and were hence found to be essentially coaligned. The magnitudes of 
      apparent metabolite diffusivities were largely ordered according to molecular 
      weight, with taurine as the smallest molecule diffusing fastest, both along and 
      across the fiber direction. CONCLUSION: Diffusivities, directional dependence of 
      diffusion and fractional anisotropies of (1) H MRS-visible muscle metabolites 
      were presented. It was shown that metabolites share diffusion directionality with 
      water and have similar fractional anisotropies, hinting at similar diffusion 
      barriers.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) grading 
      system for preoperative differentiation between benign and variant-type uterine 
      leiomyomas including smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential 
      (STUMPs). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis (Canadian Task Force classification 
      III). SETTING: Teaching hospital (Teine Keijinkai Hospital). PATIENTS: 
      Three-hundred thirteen patient medical records were retrospectively reviewed if 
      treated for uterine myomas and diagnosed with variant type leiomyomas or STUMPs 
      (n = 27) or benign, typical leiomyomas (n = 286) and treated between January 2012 
      and December 2014. INTERVENTION: Uterine myoma classifications using MRI findings 
      according to a 5-grade system (grades I-V) based on 3 elements. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      MAIN RESULTS: Uterine myoma MRI classifications were based on 3 elements: 
      T2-weighted imaging (high or low), diffusion-weighted imaging (high or low), and 
      apparent diffusion coefficient values (high or low; apparent diffusion 
      coefficient < 1.5 × 10(-3) mm(2)/sec was considered low). Grades I to II were 
      designated as typical or benign leiomyomas, grade III as degenerated leiomyomas, 
      and grades IV to V as variant type leiomyomas or STUMPs. Accuracy levels were 
      98.9%, 100%, 94.3%, 58.8%, and 41.9% for grades I through V lesions, 
      respectively. The grades were divided into 2 groups to discriminate benign 
      leiomyomas and STUMPs (grades I-III were considered negative and grades IV-V 
      positive). Grades IV to V scored 85.2% for sensitivity, 91.3% for specificity, 
      47.9% positive predictive value, 98.5% negative predictive value, a 9.745 
      positive likelihood ratio, and a .162 negative likelihood ratio. CONCLUSION: This 
      novel MRI grading system for uterine myomas may be beneficial in differentiating 
      benign leiomyomas from STUMPs or variant type leiomyomas and could be a future 
      effective presurgical assessment tool.

TI  - Congenital muscular dystrophy with merosin deficiency: 1H MR spectroscopy and 
      diffusion-weighted MR imaging.
PG  - 190-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To prospectively use hydrogen 1 ((1)H) magnetic resonance (MR) 
      spectroscopy and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps to try to explain the 
      discrepancy between the extensive white matter (WM) abnormalities observed at MR 
      imaging and the relatively mild neurocognitive decline in patients with 
      merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      hospital ethics committee approved this study, and informed consent was obtained. 
      Nine patients (five boys, four girls; age range, 3-9 years; mean, 6 years +/- 2 
      [standard deviation]) with merosin-deficient CMD underwent T1-weighted, 
      T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted MR 
      imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy, which was performed in the parieto-occipital WM 
      (POWM) and frontal WM (FWM) by using stimulated-echo acquisition mode. Metabolite 
      (N-acetylaspartate [NAA], choline-containing compounds [Cho], and myo-inositol 
      [mI]) ratios were calculated in relation to creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr) and 
      water (H(2)O). NAA/Cho was also calculated. ADCs were calculated in approximately 
      the same locations that were studied with spectroscopy. For comparison, (1)H MR 
      spectroscopy (n = 10) and ADC mapping (n = 7) were also performed in 10 healthy 
      age- and sex-matched control subjects (three boys, seven girls; age range, 4-9 
      years; mean, 6 years +/- 1). Statistical analysis involved the t test for 
      comparison between different groups; correlation between ADC and spectroscopy 
      results was studied with the Pearson test. RESULTS: MR imaging revealed evidence 
      of bilateral WM involvement in all patients. Whereas their NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr were 
      normal, their mI/Cr was slightly increased compared with that in control subjects 
      (P = .03 in FWM and P = .07 in POWM), and their NAA/Cho was decreased in POWM (P 
      = .03). NAA/H(2)O, Cr/H(2)O, Cho/H(2)O, and mI/H(2)O were considerably decreased 
      (P < .05 for all) and ADC values were increased (P < .001) in WM in all patients 
      versus these values in WM in control subjects. There was significant correlation 
      between ADC values and metabolite/water ratios (r = -0.777 to -0.967, P < .05). 
      CONCLUSION: ADC mapping and (1)H MR spectroscopy reveal abnormally high 
      free-water concentrations in the WM of patients with merosin-deficient CMD.

TI  - Quantitative MRI of visually intact rotator cuff muscles by multiecho Dixon-based 
      fat quantification and diffusion tensor imaging.
PG  - 109-117
LID - 10.1002/jmri.26223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative MRI allows assessment of shoulder rotator cuff (RC) 
      muscles by Dixon MR sequences with calculation of fractional fat content (FF%) 
      maps and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) including tractography. PURPOSE: To 
      compare FF% and DTI derived parameters among visually intact RC muscles, to 
      compare 2D with 3D DTI measurements and to establish normative values. STUDY 
      TYPE: Prospective. SUBJECTS: Forty patients aged >18 years undergoing shoulder MR 
      arthrography were included. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: MR arthrography of the 
      shoulder including 3D multiecho Dixon and 3D echo-planar DTI sequences (15 
      gradient encoding directions, b-value 600 s/mm(2) ) was performed at 3.0T. 
      ASSESSMENT: Muscles affected by RC tears or fatty infiltration of Goutallier 
      grade ≥1 were excluded. Two independent radiologists measured FF%, apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) by region-of-interest 
      (ROI) placements at the Y-position of the scapula and 3D tractography of each 
      muscle with qualitative evaluation was performed. STATISTICAL TESTS: Intraclass 
      correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Cohen's kappa were used for interreader 
      agreement and Pearson correlation coefficient to correlate quantitative measures 
      with each other and age, independent-samples t-test, one-way analysis of variance 
      (ANOVA), and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed to investigate differences 
      between genders and muscles. RESULTS: Qualitative and quantitative measurements 
      showed moderate (κ = 0.41-0.56) to almost perfect (ICC = 0.75-0.99) agreement. 
      There were weak but significant positive correlations of FF% with age (r = 0.273, 
      P < 0.05) and FA-2D (r = 0.319-0.383, P < 0.05). Significant differences were 
      found among RC muscles for ADC, radial diffusivity (RD), and tract homogeneity 
      (all P < 0.05) but not between genders (all P ≥ 0.05). High correlations of 2D 
      with 3D measurements for ADC (r = 0.639, P < 0.001) and FA (r = 0.628, P < 0.001) 
      were seen. DATA CONCLUSION: Quantitative MRI with estimation of FF% and DTI 
      parameters shows significant age-associated changes and differences among 
      visually intact RC muscles. High reproducibility and correlations of 2D with 3D 
      DTI measurements can be expected. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical Efficacy: Stage

TI  - Changes in MR diffusion properties during active muscle contraction in the calf.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To elucidate changes in the diffusion properties of muscle fiber between 
      rest and active contraction. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 10 healthy adult 
      volunteers (4 men, 6 women), we obtained diffusion tensor (DT) images (b=500 
      s/mm(2)) of bilateral calves using a 1.5-tesla clinical magnetic resonance (MR) 
      imager. We first simultaneously scanned both calves at rest, then obtained scans 
      of bilateral calves with plantar flexion of the right ankle using the same 
      imaging parameters. We measured fractional anisotropy (FA) and lambda(1), 
      lambda(2), and lambda(3) in the gastrocnemius medialis (GCM) and anterior 
      tibialis (AT) muscles of both calves by seeding the region of interest at the 
      thickest part, then calculated the right-to-left ratio of the FA and eigenvalues 
      in each muscle and compared each ratio between rest and contraction by paired 
      t-test. RESULTS: In the GCM, the FA ratio increased from 1.05 at rest to 1.17 
      after contraction, and contraction elevated the lambda1 and 2 ratios from 0.99 in 
      resting muscles to 1.06 (lambda(1)) and 1.07 (lambda(2)). In contrast, the AT 
      showed a decrease of the lambda(1) ratio from 0.99 at rest to 0.96 at elongation 
      and of the lambda(2) ratio, from and 1.01 at rest to 0.94 at elongation. 
      Statistically significant differences were observed in the FA (P<0.05), lambda1 
      and lambda2 (P<0.01) in the GCM, and the lambda1 and lambda2 (P<0.05) in the AT. 
      CONCLUSION: The higher FA and lambda(1) and lambda(2) values of muscles at 
      contraction than rest presumably reflect complicated changes, including 
      microscopic morphological changes of the diffusion-restricting factor, focal 
      temperature, and perfusion. We found that change in perfusion could affect the 
      AT, and changes in focal perfusion and temperature could influence the GCM.

AB  - During aging declining maximum force capacity with more or less unchanged 
      fatigability is observed with the underlying mechanisms still not fully 
      understood. Therefore, we compared morphology and function of skeletal muscles 
      between different age groups. Changes in high-energy phosphate turnover (PCr, Pi 
      and pH) and muscle functional MRI (mfMRI) parameters, including proton transverse 
      relaxation time (T2), diffusion (D) and vascular volume fraction (f), were 
      investigated in moderately exercised low back muscles of young and 
      late-middle-aged healthy subjects with (31)P-MR spectroscopy, T2- and 
      diffusion-weighted MRI at 3T. In addition, T1-weighted MRI data were acquired to 
      determine muscle cross-sectional areas (CSA) and to assess fat infiltration into 
      muscle tissue. Except for pH, both age groups showed similar load-induced MR 
      changes and rates of perceived exertion (RPE), which indicates comparable 
      behavior of muscle activation at moderate loads. Changes of mfMRI parameters were 
      significantly associated with RPE in both cohorts. Age-related differences were 
      observed, with lower pH and higher Pi/ATP ratios as well as lower D and f values 
      in the late-middle-aged subjects. These findings are ascribed to age-related 
      changes of fiber type composition, fiber size and vascularity. Interestingly, 
      post exercise f was negatively associated with fat infiltration with the latter 
      being significantly higher in late-middle-aged subjects. CSA of low back muscles 
      remained unchanged, while CSA of inner back muscle as well as mean T2 at rest 
      were associated with maximum force capacity. Overall, applying the proposed MR 
      approach provides evidence of age-related changes in several muscle tissue

TI  - Comparison of 3T diffusion-weighted MRI and (18)F-FDG PET/CT in musculoskeletal 
      tumours: quantitative analysis of apparent diffusion coefficients and 
      standardized uptake values.
PG  - 20181051

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on 3T MR 
      imaging including diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) correlate with the 
      standardized uptake value (SUV) on 18F-FDG PET/CT in musculoskeletal tumours. 
      METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 57 patients (36 males, 21 
      females, mean age 54 years, range 12-90 years) with pathologically confirmed soft 
      tissue (n = 32) and bone (n = 25) tumours who underwent 3T MR imaging including 
      DWI and whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT before treatment. 14 patients had follow-up MR 
      imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT after treatment. The minimum (ADC(min)) and mean 
      (ADC(mean)) ADCs of musculoskeletal tumour, ADC of normal skeletal muscle 
      (ADC(mus)), SUV(max) and SUV(mean) of musculoskeletal tumour were obtained. 
      Correlation between ADCs and SUVs was assessed using Pearson correlation 
      coefficients (r). ADC(min) and SUV(max) were compared between pretreatment and 
      posttreatment by t-test. RESULTS: There was inverse correlation between SUV(max) 
      and the ratio ADC(min)/ADC(mus) (r = - 0.505 to - 0.495, p ≤ 0.001) and between 
      SUV(mean) and the ratio ADC(mean)/ADC(mus) (r = - 0.501 to - 0.493, p = 0.001). 
      After treatment ADC was significantly increased whereas SUV was significantly 
      decreased (p = 0.001). There was significant correlation in percent change 
      between the initial and follow-up values of ADC(min) and SUV(max) (r = 0.750 to 
      0.773, p ≤ 0.005). The ADC(min) was increased by 163% and SUV(max) was decreased 
      by 61% in 11 patients with treatment response. CONCLUSION: ADC at 3T MR DWI and 
      SUV at 18F-FDG PET/CT have an inverse correlation in musculoskeletal tumours. 
      ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Our study showed that ADC at 3T DWI and SUV at 18F-FDG 
      PET/CT had an inverse correlation in musculoskeletal tumours.

TI  - High Inter-Rater Reliability of Manual Segmentation and Volume-Based Tractography 
      in Healthy and Dystrophic Human Calf Muscle.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics11091521 [doi]
LID - 1521
AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle diffusion tensor imaging (mDTI) is a promising surrogate 
      biomarker in the evaluation of muscular injuries and neuromuscular diseases. 
      Since mDTI metrics are known to vary between different muscles, separation of 
      different muscles is essential to achieve muscle-specific diffusion parameters. 
      The commonly used technique to assess DTI metrics is parameter maps based on 
      manual segmentation (MSB). Other techniques comprise tract-based approaches, 
      which can be performed in a previously defined volume. This so-called 
      volume-based tractography (VBT) may offer a more robust assessment of diffusion 
      metrics and additional information about muscle architecture through tract 
      properties. The purpose of this study was to assess DTI metrics of human calf 
      muscles calculated with two segmentation techniques-MSB and VBT-regarding their 
      inter-rater reliability in healthy and dystrophic calf muscles. METHODS: 20 
      healthy controls and 18 individuals with different neuromuscular diseases 
      underwent an MRI examination in a 3T scanner using a 16-channel Torso XL coil. 
      DTI metrics were assessed in seven calf muscles using MSB and VBT. Coefficients 
      of variation (CV) were calculated for both techniques. MSB and VBT were performed 
      by two independent raters to assess inter-rater reliability by ICC analysis and 
      Bland-Altman plots. Next to analysis of DTI metrics, the same assessments were 
      also performed for tract properties extracted with VBT. RESULTS: For both 
      techniques, low CV were found for healthy controls (≤13%) and neuromuscular 
      diseases (≤17%). Significant differences between methods were found for all 
      diffusion metrics except for λ(1). High inter-rater reliability was found for 
      both MSB and VBT (ICC ≥ 0.972). Assessment of tract properties revealed high 
      inter-rater reliability (ICC ≥ 0.974). CONCLUSIONS: Both segmentation techniques 
      can be used in the evaluation of DTI metrics in healthy controls and different 
      NMD with low rater dependency and high precision but differ significantly from 
      each other. Our findings underline that the same segmentation protocol must be 
      used to ensure comparability of mDTI data.

TI  - Multi-parametric MR imaging of quadriceps musculature in the setting of clinical 
      frailty syndrome.
PG  - 583-9
LID - 10.1007/s00256-015-2313-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome associated with loss of 
      skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia) conferring an increased risk of rapid decline 
      in health and function with increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes. The 
      purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between diffusion 
      tensor, T2 and intramuscular fat content values of the quadriceps muscle group 
      and clinical frailty status using diffusion tensor MR imaging. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Subjects were recruited from the Arizona Frailty cohort composed of all 
      females with frailty status based on the Fried criteria, including 6 non-frail 
      and 10 pre-frail/frail adults, as well as a community sample of 11 young, healthy 
      controls. Axial images of both thighs were obtained on a 3-T magnet with T1, T2 
      and diffusion tensor imaging as well as intramuscular fat analysis. Diffusion 
      tensor and T2 values were determined by region-of-interest measurements at the 
      proximal, mid and distal thirds of both thighs. Data were evaluated to determine 
      differences between measured values and frailty status. RESULTS: The mean 
      fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the bilateral quadriceps muscles 
      demonstrated significant differences (F = 7.558, p = 0.0030) between the control 
      and pre-frail/frail and non-frail and pre-frail/frail groups. There was a 
      significant difference in mean T2 (F = 21.675, p < 0.0001) and lipid content 
      (F = 19.266, p < 0.0001) among all three groups in the total quadriceps muscle 
      group. CONCLUSION: The quadriceps musculature of pre-frail/frail adults 
      demonstrated increased FA compared to young controls and non-frail adults with 
      increasing T2 and intramuscular fat among the control, non-frail and 
      pre-frail/frail categories.

TI  - Feasibility of peripheral nerve MR neurography using diffusion tensor imaging 
      adapted to skeletal muscle disease.
PG  - 560-568
LID - 10.1177/0284185117726100 [doi]
AB  - Background Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of peripheral nerves may provide 
      additional information about nerve involvement in muscular disorders, but is 
      considered difficult due to different optimal scan parameters tailored to 
      magnetic resonance (MR) signal properties of muscle and neural tissues. Purpose 
      To assess the feasibility of sciatic nerve DTI using two different approaches of 
      region of interest (ROI)-localization in DTI scans with b-values 500 s/mm(2), in 
      participants with muscular disorders and in controls. Material and Methods DTI of 
      the thigh was conducted on a 3T system in ten patients (6 men, 4 women; mean age 
      =54 ± 15 years) with neuromuscular disorders and ten controls. T1-weighted (T1W) 
      images were co-registered to fractional anisotropy (FA) color-encoded images. The 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, and fiber track length (FTL) were 
      analyzed by two operators using a freehand ROI and a single-point ROI covering 
      the sciatic nerve. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman 
      analysis were used for evaluation of inter-operator and inter-technical 
      agreement, respectively. Results Three-dimensional visualization of sciatic nerve 
      fiber was achievable using both techniques. The ICC of DTI metrics showed 
      excellent inter-operator agreement both in patients and controls. Bland-Altman 
      analysis revealed good agreement of both techniques. A maximum FTL was achieved 
      using the single-point ROI technique, but with a lower inter-operator agreement 
      (ICC = 0.99 vs. 0.83). The ADC and maximum FTL were significantly decreased in 
      patients compared to controls. Conclusion Both ROI localization techniques are 
      feasible to analyze the sciatic nerve in the setting of muscular disease. A 
      maximum FTL is reached using the single-point ROI, however, at the cost of lower 
      inter-operator agreement.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate muscle perfusion in patients with peripheral artery disease 
      (PAD) before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the limb by 
      means of MR arterial spin labeling (ASL) and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) 
      under the resting state. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with lower extremity PAD 
      were enrolled. Skeletal muscles in lower extremities were examined at rest by 
      using ASL and IVIM at 3.0 T. Imaging metrics, including blood flow (BF), 
      perfusion fraction f, diffusion coefficient D, and pseudodiffusion coefficient 
      D(⁎), were measured in the anterior, lateral, soleus, and gastrocnemius muscle 
      groups. Paired t-test was used to compare the imaging parameters before and after 
      PTA. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted between imaging parameter changes 
      and ankle brachial index (ABI) changes after PTA. RESULTS: ABI was significantly 
      improved after PTA (P < 0.001). For ASL and IVIM imaging, significant changes 
      were noted in ASL-BF and IVIM-D values in the lateral, soleus, and gastrocnemius 
      muscle groups (all P < 0.0125) when comparing pre- and postoperative 
      measurements. Changes in ASL-BF and IVIM-f values in the anterior muscle group, 
      and in IVIM-D(⁎) value in the anterior and soleus muscle groups after PTA, were 
      found to be significantly correlated with ABI improvement (all P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Multiparametric MR techniques including ASL and IVIM can detect the 
      perfusion changes of lower limb tissue before and after PTA in patients with PAD 
      under resting state.

TI  - Muscle MRI at the time of questionable disease flares in Juvenile Dermatomyositis 
      (JDM).
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s12969-017-0154-4 [doi]
LID - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: The course of JDM has improved substantially over the last 70 years 
      with early and aggressive treatments. Yet it remains difficult to detect disease 
      flares as symptoms may be mild; signs of rash and muscle weakness vary widely and 
      are often equivocal; laboratory tests of muscle enzyme levels are often normal; 
      electromyography and muscle biopsy are invasive. Alternative tools are needed to 
      help decide if more aggressive treatment is needed. Our objective is to determine 
      the effectiveness of muscle Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in detecting JDM 
      flares, and how an MRI affects physician's decision-making regarding treatment. 
      METHODS: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nationwide 
      Children's Hospital. JDM patients were consulted between 1/2005 and 6/2015. MRIs 
      were performed on both lower extremities without contrast sequentially: axial T1, 
      axial T2 fat saturation, axial and coronal inversion recovery, and axial 
      diffusion weighted. The physician decision that a JDM patient was in a flare was 
      considered the gold standard. MRI results were compared with physician's 
      decisions on whether a relapse had occurred, and if there was a concordance 
      between the assessment methods. RESULTS: Forty-five JDM patients were studied. 
      Eighty percent had weakness at diagnosis, 100% typical rash, and 73% typical 
      nail-fold capillary changes. At diagnosis, muscle enzymes were compatible with 
      JDM generally (CK 52%, LDH 62%, aldolase 72%, AST 54% abnormal). EMG was abnormal 
      in 3/8, muscle biopsy typical of JDM in 10/11, and MRI abnormal demonstrating 
      myositis in 31/40. Thirteen patients had a repeat MRI for possible flares with 
      differing indications. Three repeat MRI's were abnormal, demonstrating myositis. 
      There was moderate agreement about flares between MRI findings and physician's 
      treatment decisions (kappa = 0.59). In each abnormal MRI case the physician 
      decided to increase treatment (100% probability for flares). MRI was negative for 
      myositis in 10 patients, by which 7/10 the physicians chose to continue or to 
      taper the medications (70% probability for non-flares). CONCLUSION: A muscle MRI 
      would facilitate objective assessments of JDM flares. When an MRI shows myositis, 
      physicians tend to treat 100% of the time. When an MRI shows no myositis, 
      physicians continued the same medications or tapered medications 70% of the time. 
      Further studies would help confirm the utility and cost-effectiveness of MRI to 
      determine JDM flares.

TI  - Skeletal Muscle Involvement in Wilson Disease: Clinical and Magnetic Resonance 
      Imaging (MRI) Observations in 2 Families.
PG  - 99-104
LID - 10.1177/0883073820953305 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Skeletal muscle involvement in Wilson disease is rare. Calf muscle 
      pain might be attributed as growing pain in children. We report calf muscle 
      involvement in Wilson disease and describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      findings of leg, differential diagnosis with literature review. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Our observations describe calf muscle MRI abnormality in 5 cases of 
      Wilson disease from 2 families. The clinical presentations were neurologic in 3, 
      hepatic in 1, and asymptomatic in 1 patient. We systematically describe the 
      clinical characteristics and their calf muscle MRI findings. RESULTS: Three 
      patients had bilateral calf pain and intermittent cramps. The pain was of mild to 
      moderate intensity and managed symptomatically. Serum alkaline phosphatase, 
      creatinine phosphokinase, and needle electromyography were normal. Turbo 
      inversion recovery magnitude sequence MRI of calf muscle revealed hyperintensity 
      in bilateral gastrocnemii muscles. These muscles appear hyperintense in 
      diffusion-weighted imaging. CONCLUSION: The calf muscle involvement could be 
      attributed to muscle edema due to copper-induced muscle toxicity mediated by 
      inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase on cellular membranes of fast-twitch gastrocnemii 
      muscles which contain predominant type II myofiber. In Wilson disease patients 
      with calf pain or cramps, muscle MRI may show nonspecific gastrocnemius 
      hyperintensity. Further evaluation may give insight into its pathophysiology.

      Function in Healthy Individuals.

AB  - Maximum oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle measured by in vivo phosphorus 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS) declines with age, and negatively 
      affects whole-body aerobic capacity. However, it remains unclear whether the loss 
      of oxidative capacity is caused by reduced volume and function of mitochondria or 
      limited substrate availability secondary to impaired muscle perfusion. Therefore, 
      we sought to elucidate the role of muscle perfusion on the age-related decline of 
      muscle oxidative capacity and ultimately whole-body aerobic capacity. Muscle 
      oxidative capacity was assessed by (31)P-MRS post-exercise phosphocreatine 
      recovery time (τ(PCr)), with higher τ(PCr) reflecting lower oxidative capacity, 
      in 75 healthy participants (48 men, 22-89 years) of the Genetic and Epigenetic 
      Signatures of Translational Aging Laboratory Testing study. Muscle perfusion was 
      characterized as an index of blood volume at rest using a customized 
      diffusion-weighted MRI technique and analysis method developed in our laboratory. 
      Aerobic capacity (peak-VO(2)) was also measured during a graded treadmill 
      exercise test in the same visit. Muscle oxidative capacity, peak-VO(2), and 
      resting muscle perfusion were significantly lower at older ages independent of 
      sex, race, and body mass index (BMI). τ(PCr) was significantly associated with 
      resting muscle perfusion independent of age, sex, race, and BMI (p-value = 0.004, 
      β = -0.34). τ(PCr) was also a significant independent predictor of peak-VO(2) 
      and, in a mediation analysis, significantly attenuated the association between 
      muscle perfusion and peak-VO(2) (34% reduction for β in perfusion). These 
      findings suggest that the age-associated decline in muscle oxidative capacity is 
      partly due to impaired muscle perfusion and not mitochondrial dysfunction alone. 
      Furthermore, our findings show that part of the decline in whole-body aerobic 
      capacity observed with aging is also due to reduced microvascular blood volume at 
      rest, representing a basal capacity of the microvascular system, which is 
      mediated by muscle oxidative capacity. This finding suggests potential benefit of 
      interventions that target an overall increase in muscle perfusion for the 
      restoration of energetic capacity and mitochondrial function with aging.

TI  - How does passive lengthening change the architecture of the human medial 
      gastrocnemius muscle?
PG  - 727-738

AB  - There are few comprehensive investigations of the changes in muscle architecture 
      that accompany muscle contraction or change in muscle length in vivo. For this 
      study, we measured changes in the three-dimensional architecture of the human 
      medial gastrocnemius at the whole muscle level, the fascicle level and the fiber 
      level using anatomical MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Data were obtained 
      from eight subjects under relaxed conditions at three muscle lengths. At the 
      whole muscle level, a 5.1% increase in muscle belly length resulted in a 
      reduction in both muscle width (mean change -2.5%) and depth (-4.8%). At the 
      fascicle level, muscle architecture measurements obtained at 3,000 locations per 
      muscle showed that for every millimeter increase in muscle-tendon length above 
      the slack length, average fascicle length increased by 0.46 mm, pennation angle 
      decreased by 0.27° (0.17° in the superficial part and 0.37° in the deep part), 
      and fascicle curvature decreased by 0.18 m(-1) There was no evidence of 
      systematic variation in architecture along the muscle's long axis at any muscle 
      length. At the fiber level, analysis of the diffusion signal showed that passive 
      lengthening of the muscle increased diffusion along fibers and decreased 
      diffusion across fibers. Using these measurements across scales, we show that the 
      complex shape changes that muscle fibers, whole muscles, and aponeuroses of the 
      medial gastrocnemius undergo in vivo cannot be captured by simple geometrical 
      models. This justifies the need for more complex models that link microstructural 
      changes in muscle fibers to macroscopic changes in architecture.NEW & NOTEWORTHY 
      Novel MRI and DTI techniques revealed changes in three-dimensional architecture 
      of the human medial gastrocnemius during passive lengthening. Whole muscle belly 
      width and depth decreased when the muscle lengthened. Fascicle length, pennation, 
      and curvature changed uniformly or near uniformly along the muscle during passive 
      lengthening. Diffusion of water molecules in muscle changes in the same direction 
      as fascicle strains.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of human lower leg muscles: correlation between 
      DTI parameters and muscle power with different ankle positions.
PG  - 939-948
LID - 10.1007/s11604-022-01274-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters in healthy adult 
      human lower leg muscles and to determine the correlation between DTI parameters 
      and muscle power measurements among different types of muscle contraction. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI measurements of the unilateral lower leg muscles 
      having three different types of contraction (non-contraction state, isometric 
      contraction, and soleus shortening) were obtained from 10 healthy adults using a 
      3-T MRI scanner. DTI parameters (λ(1), λ(2), λ(3), mean diffusivity, and 
      fractional anisotropy) were calculated. The values of the DTI parameters and 
      correlation between the DTI parameters and muscle power measurements (maximum 
      power and maximum amount of work) obtained from a dynamometer were statistically 
      compared among the different types of contraction. Intra- and inter-class 
      correlation coefficients were calculated for analysis of reproducibility. 
      RESULTS: The λ(1), λ(2), λ(3,) and mean diffusivity of the soleus muscle are 
      significantly lower in the non-contraction state as compared with isometric 
      contraction and soleus shortening (p < 0.05). A positive correlation of the 
      soleus muscle in the non-contraction state was seen between the maximum power and 
      the λ(1), λ(2,) and mean diffusivity. There was a positive correlation between 
      the maximum amount of work and fractional anisotropy in the non-contraction state 
      for the soleus muscle. A negative correlation for the tibialis anterior muscle in 
      the non-contraction state was seen between the maximum amount of work and 
      fractional anisotropy. Overall reproducibility of the DTI parameters was 
      excellent. CONCLUSIONS: DTI parameters were significantly changed depending on 
      the ankle joint position and type of muscle contraction.

TI  - Effects of perfusion on DTI and DKI estimates in the skeletal muscle.
PG  - 233-246
LID - 10.1002/mrm.26373 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In this study, we evaluated the effects of perfusion of the skeletal 
      muscle on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) 
      parameters and their reproducibility. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging and DKI 
      models, with and without intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) correction, were 
      applied to simulated data at different physiological conditions and 
      signal-to-noise ratio levels. Next, the same models were applied to data of the 
      right calf of five healthy volunteers, acquired twice at 3 telsa. For six 
      muscles, we evaluated the correlation of the perfusion signal fraction, with 
      parameters derived from DTI and DKI, and performed repeatability analysis with 
      and without IVIM correction. Additionally, the IVIM correction was compared to a 
      multishell acquisition approach that minimizes perfusion effects on DTI 
      estimates. RESULTS: Simulations and acquired data showed that DTI and DKI 
      estimates were biased proportionally to the perfusion signal fraction, and that 
      IVIM correction was needed for accurate estimation of the DTI and DKI parameters. 
      However, taking perfusion into account did not improve repeatability. CONCLUSION: 
      Blood perfusion has an effect on DTI and DKI estimations, but it can be minimized 
      with IVIM correction or multishell acquisition strategies. Magn Reson Med

TI  - Conspicuity and muscle-invasiveness assessment for bladder cancer using VI-RADS: 
      a multi-reader, contrast-free MRI study to determine optimal b-values for 
      diffusion-weighted imaging.
PG  - 1862-1872
LID - 10.1007/s00261-022-03490-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To (1) compare bladder cancer (BC) muscle invasiveness among three 
      b-values using a contrast-free approach based on Vesical Imaging-Reporting and 
      Data System (VI-RADS), to (2) determine if muscle-invasiveness assessment is 
      affected by the reader experience, and to (3) compare BC conspicuity among three 
      b-values, qualitatively and quantitatively. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients who 
      underwent a bladder MRI on a 3.0-T scanner were enrolled. The gold standard was 
      histopathology report following transurethral resection of BC. Three sets of 
      images, including T2w and different b-values for DWI, set 1 (b = 1000 s/mm(2)), 
      set 2 (b = 1500 s/mm(2)), and set 3 (b = 2000 s/mm(2)), were reviewed by three 
      differently experienced readers. Descriptive statistics and Intraclass 
      Correlation Coefficient (ICC) were calculated. Comparisons among readers and DWI 
      sets were performed with the Wilcoxon test. Receiver operating characteristic 
      (ROC) analysis was performed. Areas under the curves (AUCs) and pairwise 
      comparison were calculated. RESULTS: AUCs of muscle-invasiveness assessment 
      ranged from 0.896 to 0.984 (reader 1), 0.952-0.968 (reader 2), and 0.952-0.984 
      (reader 3) without significant differences among different sets and readers 
      (p > 0.05). The mean conspicuity qualitative scores were higher in Set 1 
      (2.21-2.33), followed by Set 2 (2-2.16) and Set 3 (1.82-2.14). The quantitative 
      conspicuity assessment showed that mean normalized intensity of tumor was 
      significantly higher in Set 2 (4.217-4.737) than in Set 1 (3.923-4.492) and Set 3 
      (3.833-3.992) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Muscle invasiveness can be assessed with 
      high accuracy using a contrast-free protocol with T2W and DWI, regardless of 
      reader's experience. b = 1500 s/mm(2) showed the best tumor delineation, while 
      b = 1000 s/mm(2) allowed for better tumor-wall interface assessment.

TI  - Effect of clenching on T2 and diffusion parameters of the masseter muscle.
PG  - 58-63
LID - 10.3109/02841850903280508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent muscle contractions during clenching are considered to be 
      one reason for temporomandibular disorders. However, no report has evaluated the 
      effect of clenching on the masticatory muscles, as measured by magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI). PURPOSE: To investigate whether clenching has an effect on either 
      T(2) or the coefficients for diffusion of the masseter muscles (MM), and to 
      evaluate the effect of the distribution of bite force on such indices. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: Twenty-three subjects were examined. Bite force was measured by a 
      pressure-sensitive sheet, and the force of the right and the left sides was 
      calculated. MRI was used to evaluate T(2), the apparent diffusion coefficient 
      (ADC), and the primary (lambda(1)), secondary (lambda(2)), and tertiary 
      eigenvalues (lambda(3)). These indices on the stronger side of the bite force 
      were compared to those on the weaker side. Thereafter, the indices were compared 
      between at rest and during clenching. RESULTS: There was no significant 
      difference in any of the indices (T(2), ADC, lambda(1), lambda(2), and lambda(3)) 
      between the side of stronger bite force and the side with weaker. T(2) increased 
      by clenching, and the difference was significant in the side with stronger bite 
      force (P = 0.006). ADC, lambda(1), lambda(2), and lambda(3) increased 
      significantly by clenching (P <0.01, P <0.01, P <0.01, and P <0.01, respectively) 
      on both sides. The percentage of change of lambda(2) by clenching was 
      26.2+/-15.7% on the stronger side and 26.9+/-18.6% on the weaker side, which was 
      significantly greater than either that of lambda(1) or lambda(3). CONCLUSION: The 
      coefficients for diffusion of the MM were sensitive to change by clenching, and 
      lambda(2) was the most sensitive. Moreover, the relative distribution of the bite 
      forces had no effect on any of the indices.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging reveals changes in non-fat infiltrated muscles in late 
      onset Pompe disease.
PG  - 541-549
LID - 10.1002/mus.27021 [doi]
AB  - MRI is a helpful tool for monitoring disease progression in late-onset Pompe 
      disease (LOPD). Our study aimed to evaluate if muscle diffusion tensor imaging 
      (mDTI) shows alterations in muscles of LOPD patients with <10% fat-fraction. We 
      evaluated 6 thigh and 7 calf muscles (both legs) of 18 LOPD and 29 healthy 
      controls (HC) with muscle diffusion tensor imaging (mDTI), T1w, and mDixonquant 
      sequences in a 3T MRI scanner. The quantitative mDTI-values axial diffusivity 
      (λ(1) ), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) as well as fat-fraction were analyzed. 6-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT) 
      data were correlated to diffusion metrics. We found that mDTI showed significant 
      differences between LOPD and HC in diffusion parameters (P < .05). Thigh muscles 
      with <10% fat-fraction showed significant differences in MD, RD, and λ(1-3) . MD 
      positively correlated with 6-MWT (P = .06). To conclude, mDTI reveals diffusion 
      restrictions in muscles of LOPD with and without fat-infiltration and reflects 
      structural changes prior to fatty degeneration.

TI  - Muscle changes detected with diffusion-tensor imaging after long-distance 
      running.
PG  - 548-62
LID - 10.1148/radiol.14140702 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a protocol for diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) of the complete 
      upper legs and to demonstrate feasibility of detection of subclinical 
      sports-related muscle changes in athletes after strenuous exercise, which remain 
      undetected by using conventional T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with 
      fat suppression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research was approved by the 
      institutional ethics committee review board, and the volunteers provided written 
      consent before the study. Five male amateur long-distance runners underwent an MR 
      examination (DTI, T1-weighted MR imaging, and T2-weighted MR imaging with fat 
      suppression) of both upper legs 1 week before, 2 days after, and 3 weeks after 
      they participated in a marathon. The tensor eigenvalues (λ1, λ2, and λ3), the 
      mean diffusivity, and the fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived from the DTI 
      data. Data per muscle from the three time-points were compared by using a two-way 
      mixed-design analysis of variance with a Bonferroni posthoc test. RESULTS: The 
      DTI protocol allowed imaging of both complete upper legs with adequate 
      signal-to-noise ratio and within a 20-minute imaging time. After the marathon, 
      T2-weighted MR imaging revealed grade 1 muscle strains in nine of the 180 
      investigated muscles. The three eigenvalues, mean diffusivity, and FA were 
      significantly increased (P < .05) in the biceps femoris muscle 2 days after 
      running. Mean diffusivity and eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 were significantly (P < .05) 
      increased in the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles 2 days after the marathon. 
      CONCLUSION: A feasible method for DTI measurements of the upper legs was 
      developed that fully included frequently injured muscles, such as hamstrings, in 
      one single imaging session. This study also revealed changes in DTI parameters 
      that over time were not revealed by qualitative T2-weighted MR imaging with fat 
      suppression.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted MR imaging for characterizing musculoskeletal lesions.
PG  - 1163-77
LID - 10.1148/rg.345140190 [doi]
AB  - Diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging is a functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 
      technique that can readily be incorporated into a routine non-contrast 
      material-enhanced MR imaging protocol with little additional scanning time. DW 
      imaging is based on changes in the Brownian motion of water molecules caused by 
      tissue microstructure. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a quantitative 
      measure of Brownian movement: Low ADC values typically reflect highly cellular 
      microenvironments in which diffusion is restricted by the presence of cell 
      membranes, whereas acellular regions allow free diffusion and result in elevated 
      ADC values. Thus, with ADC mapping, one may derive useful quantitative 
      information regarding the cellularity of a musculoskeletal lesion using a 
      nonenhanced technique. The role of localized DW imaging in differentiating 
      malignant from benign osseous and soft-tissue lesions is still evolving; when 
      carefully applied, however, this modality has proved helpful in a subset of tumor 
      types, such as nonmyxoid soft-tissue tumors. Studies of the use of DW imaging in 
      assessing the treatment response of both osseous and soft-tissue tumors have 
      shown that higher ADC values correlate with better response to cytotoxic therapy. 
      Successful application of DW imaging in the evaluation of musculoskeletal lesions 
      requires familiarity with potential diagnostic pitfalls that stem from technical 
      artifacts and confounding factors unrelated to lesion cellularity. Further 
      investigation is needed to evaluate the impact of DW imaging-ADC mapping on 
      management and outcome in patients with musculoskeletal lesions.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging reveals the effects of different 
      cooling temperatures on the diffusion of water molecules and perfusion within 
      human skeletal muscle.
PG  - 874-80
LID - 10.1016/j.crad.2010.06.005 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effect of local cooling on the diffusion of water molecules 
      and perfusion within muscle at different cooling temperatures. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted (DW) images of the leg (seven 
      males) were obtained before and after 30 min cooling (0, 10, and 20°C), and after 
      a 30 min recovery period. Two types of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC; ADC1, 
      reflecting both water diffusion and perfusion within muscle, and ADC2, 
      approximating the true water diffusion coefficient) of the ankle dorsiflexors 
      were calculated from DW images. T2-weighted images were also obtained to 
      calculate T2 values of the ankle dorsiflexors. The skin temperature was measured 
      before, during, and after cooling. RESULTS: Both ADC values significantly 
      decreased after cooling under all cooling conditions; the rate of decrease 
      depended on the cooling temperature used (ADC1: -36% at 0°C, -27.8% at 10°C, and 
      -22.6% at 20°C; ADC2: -26% at 0°C, -21.1% at 10°C, and -14.6% at 20°C). These 
      significant decreases were maintained during the recovery period. Conversely, the 
      T2 value showed no significant changes. Under all cooling conditions, skin 
      temperature significantly decreased during cooling; the rate of decrease depended 
      on the cooling temperature used (-74.8% at 0°C, -51.1% at 10°C, and -26.8% at 
      20°C). Decreased skin temperatures were not restored to pre-cooling values during 
      the recovery period under any cooling conditions. CONCLUSION: Local cooling 
      decreased the water diffusion and perfusion within muscle with decreased skin 
      temperature; the rates of decrease depended on the cooling temperature used. 
      These decreases were maintained for 30 min after cooling.

TI  - Lipid and smooth muscle architectural pathology in the rabbit atherosclerotic 
      vessel wall using Q-space cardiovascular magnetic resonance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is an arterial vessel wall disease characterized by 
      slow, progressive lipid accumulation, smooth muscle disorganization, and 
      inflammatory infiltration. Atherosclerosis often remains subclinical until 
      extensive inflammatory injury promotes vulnerability of the atherosclerotic 
      plaque to rupture with luminal thrombosis, which can cause the acute event of 
      myocardial infarction or stroke. Current bioimaging techniques are unable to 
      capture the pathognomonic distribution of cellular elements of the plaque and 
      thus cannot accurately define its structural disorganization. METHODS: We applied 
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance spectroscopy (CMRS) and diffusion weighted CMR 
      (DWI) with generalized Q-space imaging (GQI) analysis to architecturally define 
      features of atheroma and correlated these to the microscopic distribution of 
      vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), immune cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) 
      fibers, thrombus, and cholesteryl esters (CE). We compared rabbits with normal 
      chow diet and cholesterol-fed rabbits with endothelial balloon injury, which 
      accelerates atherosclerosis and produces advanced rupture-prone plaques, in a 
      well-validated rabbit model of human atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Our methods 
      revealed new structural properties of advanced atherosclerosis incorporating SMC 
      and lipid distributions. GQI with tractography portrayed the locations of these 
      components across the atherosclerotic vessel wall and differentiated multi-level 
      organization of normal, pro-inflammatory cellular phenotypes, or thrombus. 
      Moreover, the locations of CE were differentiated from cellular constituents by 
      their higher restrictive diffusion properties, which permitted chemical 
      confirmation of CE by high field voxel-guided CMRS. CONCLUSIONS: GQI with 
      tractography is a new method for atherosclerosis imaging that defines a 
      pathological architectural signature for the atheromatous plaque composed of 
      distributed SMC, ECM, inflammatory cells, and thrombus and lipid. This provides a 
      detailed transmural map of normal and inflamed vessel walls in the setting of 
      atherosclerosis that has not been previously achieved using traditional CMR 
      techniques. Although this is an ex-vivo study, detection of micro and mesoscale 
      level vascular destabilization as enabled by GQI with tractography could increase 
      the accuracy of diagnosis and assessment of treatment outcomes in individuals 
      with atherosclerosis.

AB  - Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the clinically devastating CNS features 
      of myotonic dystrophy (DM) remain more enigmatic and controversial than do the 
      muscle abnormalities of this common form of muscular dystrophy. To better define 
      CNS and cranial muscle changes in DM, we used quantitative volumetric and 
      diffusion tensor MRI methods to measure cerebral and masticatory muscle 
      differences between controls (n=5) and adults with either congenital (n=5) or 
      adult onset (n=5) myotonic dystrophy type 1 and myotonic dystrophy type 2 (n=5). 
      Muscle volumes were diminished in DM1 and strongly correlated with reduced white 
      matter integrity and gray matter volume. Moreover, correlation of reduced 
      fractional anisotropy (white matter integrity) and gray matter volume in both DM1 
      and DM2 suggests that these abnormalities may share a common underlying 
      pathophysiological mechanism. Further quantitative temporal and spatial 
      characterization of these features will help delineate developmental and 
      progressive neurological components of DM, and help determine the causative 
      molecular and cellular mechanisms.

TI  - Evaluation of skeletal muscle DTI in patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 1589-97
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3427 [doi]
AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a popular method to assess differences in fiber 
      organization in diseased and healthy muscle tissue. Previous work has shown that 
      muscle DTI measurements depend on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), %fat, and tissue 
      T2. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential biasing effects of these 
      factors on skeletal muscle DTI data in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
      (DMD). MR images were obtained of the right lower leg of 21 DMD patients and 12 
      healthy controls on a Philips 3T system. DTI measurements were combined with 
      quantitative in-vivo measures of mean water T2, %fat and SNR to evaluate their 
      effect on DTI parameter estimation. All outcome measures were determined within 
      ROIs drawn for six lower leg muscles. Between group analysis, using all ROIs, 
      revealed a significantly elevated FA in the GCL, SOL and PER muscles (p<0.05) and 
      an increased mean diffusivity (p<0.05) and λ3 (p<0.05) in the TA muscle of DMD 
      patients. In-vivo evaluation of the individual confounders showed behaviour in 
      line with predictions from previous simulation work. To account for these 
      confounders, subsequent analysis used only ROIs with SNR greater than 20. With 
      this criterion we found significantly greater MD in the TA muscle of DMD patient 
      (p<0.009) and λ3 in the TA and GCL muscles (p<0.001) of DMD patients, but no 
      differences in FA. As both increased %fat and lower SNR are expected to reduce 
      the apparent MD and λ3, these between-group differences are likely due to 
      pathophysiology. However, the increased FA, observed when using all ROIs, likely 
      reflects the effect of low SNR and %fat on the DTI parameter estimation. These 
      findings suggest that measuring mean water T2, %fat and SNR is essential to 
      ascribe changes in DTI measures to intrinsic diffusion changes or to confounding 
      influences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate role of multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) in differentiation 
      between invasive and non-invasive bladder cancer and accuracy of vesical imaging 
      reporting and data system (VI-RADS) score. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 50 patients 
      diagnosed as cancer bladder were enrolled in this study, mp-MRI including 
      conventional (T(1) weighted imaging and high resolution T(2) weighted imaging) 
      and functional sequences (diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast 
      enhanced-MRI) were done, all data were regrouped to evaluate the accuracy of each 
      separate sequence and mp-MRI in distinguishing non-muscle invasive from 
      muscle-invasive tumors, with VI-RADS score application and comparison with 
      pathological findings, then interobserver agreement for detection of muscle 
      invasion according to mp-MRI and VI-RADS scoring system findings was calculated. 
      RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy of mp-MRI in differentiation between muscle invasive 
      and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer was (84%) with highest sensitivity (78%), 
      very good agreement between mp-MRI and histopathological data (k = 0.87), and 
      highest area under curve (AUC) reaching 0.83, dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI 
      sequence showed the highest accuracy in muscle invasion detection by (88%), with 
      highest AUC 0.83. Diagnostic accuracy of VI-RADS score in detection of muscle 
      invasion was 84%, with specificity and negative predictive value of 88% and AUC 
      was 0.83. Interobserver agreement was strong as regard diagnostic performance of 
      mp-MRI and VI-RADS scoring for detection of muscle invasion reaching (K = 0.82, p 
      < 0.001) and (K = 0.87, p < 0.001) respectively. CONCLUSION: mp-MRI is considered 
      as comprehensive and effective tool for determination of muscle invasion in cases 
      of urinary bladder cancer. Also VI-RADS scoring system can accurately 
      differentiate between invasive and non-invasive bladder cancer. ADVANCES IN 
      KNOWLEDGE: The VI-RADS system was recently suggested for the uniform evaluation 
      of muscle invasion in cancer bladder by mp-MRI. In this paper, we applied this 
      system to 50 cases to evaluate its ease and compared the results with the 
      histopathological findings for evaluation of its accuracy.

PG  - 333-42

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) in the differentiation 
      between uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) / smooth muscle tumor with uncertain 
      malignant potential (STUMP) and benign leiomyoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      consecutive cohort of 8 LMS/STUMP and 25 benign leiomyomas underwent pelvic MRI 
      exam at 3T. Two radiologists independently evaluated images based on CE-MRI 
      (central nonenhancement at equilibrial phase) and DWI (hyperintensity on b = 1000 
      s/mm2 and hypointensity on apparent diffusion coefficients [ADC] map). The ADC 
      values were calculated from b = 0 and 1000 s/mm2 . RESULTS: CE-MRI yielded a 
      significantly superior diagnostic accuracy (0.94 vs. 0.52) and a significantly 
      higher specificity (0.96 vs. 0.36) than DWI (P < 0.05 for both), and remained a 
      comparably high sensitivity as DWI (0.88 vs. 1.00). A combination of DWI and ADC 
      value <1.08 × 10(-3) mm2 /s (determined by receiver operating characteristic 
      analysis) improved diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of DWI to 
      0.88, 0.88, and 0.88, respectively, by post-hoc analysis based on the same study 
      cohort. CONCLUSION: For prospective differentiation between uterine LMS/STUMP and 
      benign leiomyoma, CE-MRI can provide accurate information and is preferable to 
      DWI. Combination of DWI and ADC values can achieve a comparable diagnostic 
      accuracy to CE-MRI.

AB  - The study examined which of a number of different magnetic resonance (MR) methods 
      were sensitive to detecting muscle damage induced by eccentric exercise. 
      Seventeen healthy, physically active participants, with muscle damage confirmed 
      by non-MR methods were tested 24 h after performing eccentric exercise. 
      Techniques investigated whether damage could be detected within the quadriceps 
      muscle as a whole, and individually within the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis 
      (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and vastus intermedius (VI). Relative to baseline 
      values, significant changes were seen in leg and muscle cross-sectional areas and 
      volumes and the resting inorganic phosphate concentration. Significant time 
      effects over all muscles were also seen in the transverse relaxation time (T2) 
      and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, with individually significant 
      changes seen in the VL, VM, and VI for T2 and in the VI for ADC. A significant 
      correlation was found between muscle volume and the average T2 change (r = 0.59) 
      but not between T2 and ADC or Pi alterations. There were no significant time 
      effects over all muscles for magnetization transfer contrast images, for baseline 
      pH, phosphocreatine (PCr), phosphodiester, or ATP metabolite concentrations or 
      the time constant describing the rate of PCr recovery following exercise.

TI  - Diffusion property differences of the lower leg musculature between athletes and

PG  - 277-84
LID - 10.1007/s10334-011-0294-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: To compare the differences in diffusion properties--namely fractional 
      anisotropy (FA), three eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor (λ1, λ2, and λ3), and 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)--between athletically-trained and untrained 
      lower leg musculature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve athletes (Group A) and 11 
      non-athletes (Group B) were recruited. All were females in their 20s. We scanned 
      diffusion tensor images of both calves and compared FA, the three eigenvalues, 
      and ADC in the gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, soleus (SOL), and 
      anterior tibialis muscles between Groups A and B, and between the right and left 
      sides, using two-factor fractional ANOVA. RESULTS: In all muscles of bilateral 
      calves, all three eigenvalues and ADC were lower in Group A than in Group B, with 
      statistically significant differences in all muscles for λ1, λ2, and λ3 and ADC, 
      with a P value of <0.01. Moreover, statistical differences were also found 
      between right and left for λ1, λ2, and λ3 (P < 0.05), and ADC (P < 0.01) of the 
      SOL muscle. FA showed no statistically significant differences in any muscles. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that training causes a decrease of the three 
      eigenvalues and ADC, which we hypothesize is due to an increase of density of 
      myofilaments in the intracellular space, and deformation of the cell induced by 
      enlargement of extracellular components.

AB  - Multiple nonmorphologic magnetic resonance sequences are available in 
      musculoskeletal imaging that can provide additional information to better 
      characterize and diagnose musculoskeletal disorders and diseases. These sequences 
      include blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD), arterial spin labeling (ASL), 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI). BOLD and 
      ASL provide different methods to evaluate skeletal muscle microperfusion. The 
      BOLD signal reflects the ratio between oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. ASL 
      uses selective tagging of inflowing blood spins in a specific region for 
      calculating local perfusion. DWI and DTI provide information about the structural 
      integrity of soft tissue including muscles and fibers as well as pathologies.

AB  - Muscular recovery after exercise is an important topic in sports medicine, and 
      accurate and quantitative measurements of changes in muscle are required to 
      assess muscular recovery. In the present study, we report a new analytical method 
      to measure muscular changes quantitatively. The technique consists of three 
      independent methods: image processing of two-dimensional MR images, morphological 
      analysis using three-dimensional MR images, and diffusion tensor MRI. Using this 
      method, we investigated changes in the quadriceps and biceps femoris and gluteus 
      maximus muscles and surrounding tissues before and after 1 mo of exercise wearing 
      training equipment. The subjects were 21 healthy adult female volunteers, 14 of 
      whom wore training equipment and 7 who wore normal equipment. The percentage of 
      adipose tissue in muscle after exercise in subjects who wore training equipment 
      was on average 4.4% (P < 0.001) lower than that before exercise, and the peak 
      point of the dorsal hip after exercise with use of the equipment was on average 
      10.8 mm higher than that before exercise. Further, the fractional anisotropy of 
      water diffusion in muscles increased by an average of 0.039 (P < 0.001) after 
      exercise with use of training equipment. In contrast, there was no significant 
      difference before and after exercise in subjects who wore normal equipment. These 
      results show that walking exercise while wearing training equipment thickens and 
      tightens the muscular fiber tissues. This noninvasive measurement approach may 
      allow quantitation of the athletic ability of the muscles, which is not measured 
      conventionally, and is an effective method for analyzing skeletal muscles.

TI  - The effect of ageing on skeletal muscle as assessed by quantitative MR imaging: 
      an association with frailty and muscle strength.
PG  - 291-301
LID - 10.1007/s40520-020-01530-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscles undergo changes with ageing which can cause 
      sarcopenia that can result in frailty. Quantitative MRI may detect the 
      muscle-deficit component of frailty which could help improve the understanding of 
      ageing muscles. AIMS: To investigate whether quantitative MRI measures of T2, fat 
      fraction (FF), diffusion tensor imaging and muscle volume can detect differences 
      within the muscles between three age groups, and to assess how these measures 
      compare with frailty index, gait speed and muscle power. METHODS: 18 'young' 
      (18-30 years), 18 'middle-aged' (31-68 years) and 18 'older' (> 69 years) healthy 
      participants were recruited. Participants had an MRI of their dominant thigh. 
      Knee extension and flexion power and handgrip strength were measured. Frailty 
      (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing frailty index) and gait speed were measured 
      in the older participants. RESULTS: Young participants had a lower muscle MRI T2, 
      FF and mean diffusivity than middle-aged and older participants; middle-aged 
      participants had lower values than older participants. Young participants had 
      greater muscle flexion and extension power, muscle volume and stronger hand grip 
      than middle-aged and older participants; middle-aged participants had greater 
      values than the older participants. Quantitative MRI measurements correlated with 
      frailty index, gait speed, grip strength and muscle power. DISCUSSION: 
      Quantitative MRI and strength measurements can detect muscle differences due to 
      ageing. Older participants had raised T2, FF and mean diffusivity and lower 
      muscle volume, grip strength and muscle power. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative MRI 
      measurements correlate with frailty and muscle function and could be used for 
      identifying differences across age groups within muscle.

AB  - In this study, we assessed the physiological changes after exercising or cooling 
      skeletal muscles on the basis of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values 
      in magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted images (DWIs). DWIs of the ankle 
      dorsiflexors were acquired with a 1.5-T MR device before and after exercising (22 
      subjects) or cooling (19 subjects). The exercise comprised a 5-min walk with the 
      ankles dorsiflexed and a 30-time ankle dorsiflexion. Cooling (0 degrees C) of the 
      ankle dorsiflexors was performed for 30 min. ADC values were calculated as 
      ADC1-reflecting diffusion and perfusion and ADC2-approximating the true diffusion 
      coefficient of the ankle dorsiflexors before and after exercising or cooling. 
      ADC1 and ADC2 significantly increased with exercise and decreased with cooling (P 
      < 0.05). Considering both diffusion and perfusion, ADC values allowed us to 
      evaluate the intramuscular changes induced by exercising or cooling in terms of 
      the motion of water molecules and microcirculation.

TI  - Evaluation of muscle tears in professional athletes using diffusion-weighted 
      imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient: preliminary results.
PG  - 238-244
LID - 10.23750/abm.v90i3.7157 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Many studies have evaluated the role of DWI in musculoskeletal diseases 
      but less is known on muscle tears. Especially for professional athletes, muscle 
      injuries are responsible for large time lost. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate on potential relationship between the muscle tear degree and the 
      diffusion characteristics. METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients signed 
      a comprehensive consent form according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines 
      before proceeding with all examinations. It satisfied all the requirements of the 
      Declaration of Helsinki and the Italian national law for the protection of 
      personal data. We have analyzed 38 professional athletes (36 males; mean 
      age±standard deviation 27±8 years) with a muscle tear. They were 26 football and 
      12 athletics players, with clinically suspected injuries of the lower limbs 
      muscles. All of patients underwent a 1.5-T MRI with standard protocol (STIR, TSE 
      T2, SE T1, PD T2, PD fat sat T2) plus the DWI sequences with 0, 400 and 800 
      B-values (s/mm2). Per each B value, an experienced radiologist measured the 
      signal intensity (SI, in arbitrary units [au]) using a region of interest (ROI) 
      placed within the tear on DWI images. SI drop off at the third B value was 
      calculated referred to the first B value. Similarly, ADC was measured using the 
      ADC map in a small ROI within the tear. Bivariate associations were evaluated 
      using the Student t test. Logistic regression was performed using the tear degree 
      as dependent variable. Data were given as mean±standard deviation. RESULTS: 
      According the Muller-Wohlfarth classification, the 38 muscle tears were 
      classified in type 3a in 22/38 cases and 3b in 16/38 cases. At bivariate 
      analysis, 3a-tears had a SI at the third B value (24±9 au) lower (P=0.003) than 
      that of 3b-tears (34±9 au). Similarly, 3a-tears had a SI drop off (73±10%) lower 
      (P=0.008) than that of 3b-tears (82±9%). ADC was not significantly associated to 
      tear degree (P=0.093). At regression analysis, SI at the third B value was the 
      only independent predictor of the tear degree (P=0.032), while the SI drop off 
      was borderline significant (P=0.070). CONCLUSION: This preliminary data showed a 
      positive correlation between the degree of muscle tears and the SI at the third 
      B-value. Compared to 3a- tears, 3b-tears tend to show higher SI and a higher SI 
      drop off.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the changes of muscle conditions of lower leg after 
      stretch shortening cycle exercises by MRI. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study 
      included 20 healthy male adult volunteers. After conducting control MRI, each 
      subject performed 3 sets of exercise loading, each set consisting of 100 
      repetitions of rebound jumping on one foot. MRIs were performed immediately after 
      exercise loading (0 h), 6, 30, and 168 h later. After constructing 
      T1/T2/Fractional Anisotropy (FA)/Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps, the 
      changes of three skeletal muscles of the leg (the tibialis anterior [TA], soleus 
      [SOL], and gastrocnemius [GA]) were quantitatively evaluated in each map at each 
      time point. RESULTS: The T1 and T2 values were prolonged after exercise loading, 
      and there was a delay in the recovery of T1 at 6 and 30 h after exercise loading, 
      as compared to those of T2 values over time. The ADC values were elevated in all 
      three muscles immediately after exercise loading, then recovered more slowly than 
      T1 and T2, and still had not returned to baseline 168 h after exercise loading. 
      The FA value decreased in all three muscles after exercise loading, with the 
      greatest decrease occurring immediately after exercise loading. As with the ADC 
      values, the FA values were slow to recover from the decrease, and had not 
      returned to baseline levels 168 h post-loading. CONCLUSION: The delay of T1 value 
      recovery suggested that the T1 value may reflect the muscle condition like 
      fatigue and damage. Changes in the ADC and FA values over time suggested that 
      structural changes such as minute muscular injuries can be detected by 
      diffusion-weighted MRI. Meanwhile, the changes observed in the T1 and T2 values 
      suggested that the measured relaxation time data reflected not only the water 
      volume in the muscle, but also the muscle condition after exercise loading.

TI  - Assessing skeletal muscle mass: historical overview and state of the art.
PG  - 9-18
LID - 10.1007/s13539-014-0130-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even though skeletal muscle (SM) is the largest body compartment in 
      most adults and a key phenotypic marker of sarcopenia and cachexia, SM mass was 
      until recently difficult and often impractical to quantify in vivo. This review 
      traces the historical development of SM mass measurement methods and their 
      evolution to advances that now promise to provide in-depth noninvasive measures 
      of SM composition. METHODS: Key steps in the advancement of SM measurement 
      methods and their application were obtained from historical records and widely 
      cited publications over the past two centuries. Recent advances were established 
      by collecting information on notable studies presented at scientific meetings and 
      their related publications. RESULTS: The year 1835 marks the discovery of 
      creatine in meat by Chevreul, a finding that still resonates today in the 
      D3-creatine method of measuring SM mass. Matiegka introduced an anthropometric 
      approach for estimating SM mass in 1921 with the vision of creating a human 
      "capacity" marker. The 1940s saw technological advances eventually leading up to 
      the development of ultrasound and bioimpedance analysis methods of quantifying SM 
      mass in vivo. Continuing to seek an elusive SM mass "reference" method, 
      Burkinshaw and Cohn introduced the whole-body counting-neutron activation 
      analysis method and provided some of the first detailed reports of cancer 
      cachexia in the late 1970s. Three transformative breakthroughs leading to the 
      current SM mass reference methods appeared in the 1970s and early 1980s as 
      follows: the introduction of computed tomography (CT), photon absorptiometry, and 
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Each is advanced as an accurate and/or practical 
      approach to quantifying whole-body and regional SM mass across the lifespan. 
      These advances have led to a new understanding of fundamental body size-SM mass 
      relationships that are now widely applied in the evaluation and monitoring of 
      patients with sarcopenia and cachexia. An intermediate link between SM mass and 
      function is SM composition. Advances in water-fat MR imaging, diffusion tensor 
      imaging, MR elastography, imaging of connective tissue structures by ultra-short 
      echo time MR, and other new MR approaches promise to close the gap that now 
      exists between SM anatomy and function. CONCLUSIONS: The global efforts of 
      scientists over the past two centuries provides us with highly accurate means by 
      which to measure SM mass across the lifespan with new advances promising to 
      extend these efforts to noninvasive methods for quantifying SM composition.

      including T2-weighted images (T2W) and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) can be 
      considered an accurate alternative to the standard multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI), 
      consisting of T2, DWI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging for the 
      muscle-invasiveness assessment of bladder cancer (BC), and (2) to evaluate how 
      the diagnostic performance of differently experienced readers is affected 
      according to the type of MRI protocol. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients who 
      underwent a clinically indicated bladder mp-MRI on a 3-T scanner were 
      prospectively enrolled. Trans-urethral resection of bladder was the gold 
      standard. Two sets of images, set 1 (bp-MRI) and set 2 (mp-MRI), were 
      independently reviewed by four readers. Descriptive statistics, including 
      sensitivity and specificity, were calculated for each reader. Receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed, and the areas under the curve (AUCs) 
      were calculated for the bp-MRI and the standard mp-MRI. Pairwise comparison of 
      the ROC curves was performed. RESULTS: The AUCs for bp- and mp-MRI were 
      respectively 0.91-0.92 (reader 1), 0.90 (reader 2), 0.95-0.90 (reader 3), and 
      0.90-0.87 (reader 4). Sensitivity was 100% for both protocols and specificity 
      ranged between 79.31 and 89.66% and between 79.31 and 83.33% for bp-MRI and 
      mp-MRI, respectively. No significant differences were shown between the two MRI 
      protocols (p > 0.05). No significant differences were shown accordingly to the 
      reader's experience (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A bp-MRI protocol consisting of T2W 
      and DWI has comparable diagnostic accuracy to the standard mp-MRI protocol for 
      the detection of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The experience of the reader 
      does not significantly affect the diagnostic performance using VI-RADS. KEY 
      POINTS: • The contrast-free MRI protocol shows a comparable accuracy to the 
      standard multiparametric MRI protocol in the bladder cancer muscle-invasiveness 
      assessment. • VI-RADS classification helps non-expert radiologists to assess the 
      muscle-invasiveness of bladder cancer. • DCE should be carefully interpreted by 
      less experienced readers due to inflammatory changes representing a potential 
      pitfall.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An ever-increasing technological development in the field of 
      radiology urges a need for guidelines to provide predictable and just health 
      services. A musculoskeletal guideline was developed in Norway in 2014, without 
      active implementation. PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of active guideline 
      implementation on the use of musculoskeletal diagnostic imaging most frequently 
      encountered in general practice (pain in the neck, shoulders, lower back, and 
      knees). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The total number of outpatient radiological 
      examinations across modalities registered at the Norwegian Health Economics 
      Administration between January 2013 and February 2019 was assessed using an 
      interrupted time series design. RESULTS: A 12% reduction in the total examination 
      of Magnetic Resonance Imaging shoulder and knee, and x-ray lower back and 
      shoulder was found at a significant level (p = 0.05). Stratified analysis 
      (Magnetic Resonance Imaging examination as one group and x-ray examinations as 
      the other) showed that this reduction mainly was due to the reduction in the use 
      of Magnetic Resonance Imaging examinations (shoulder and knee) which was reduced 
      by 24% at a significant level (p = 0.002), while x-ray examinations had no 
      significant level change (p = 0.71). No other statistically significant changes 
      were found. CONCLUSION: The impact of the implementation on the use of imaging of 
      the neck, shoulder, lower back, and knee is uncertain. Significant reductions 
      were demonstrated in the use of some examinations in the intervention county, but 
      similar effects were not seen when including a control group in the analysis. 
      This indicates a diffusion of the implementation, or other interventions or 
      events that affected both counties and occurred in the intervention period.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) of muscles is a promising tool to measure 
      disease progression or to assess therapeutic effects in neuromuscular diseases. 
      Longitudinal imaging studies are needed to show sensitivity of qMRI in detecting 
      disease progression in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). In this pilot study we 
      therefore studied one-year changes in quantitative MR parameters in relation to 
      clinical scores. METHODS: We repeated quantitative 3 T MR analysis of thigh 
      muscles and clinical testing one year after baseline in 10 treatment-naïve 
      patients with SMA, 5 with Type 2 (21.6 ± 7.0 years) and 5 with Type 3 (33.4 ± 
      11.9 years). MR protocol consisted of Dixon, T(2) mapping and diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI). The temporal relation of parameters was examined with a mixed 
      model. RESULTS: We detected a significant increase in fat fraction (baseline, 
      38.2% SE 0.6; follow-up, 39.5% SE 0.6; +1.3%, p = 0.001) in all muscles. Muscles 
      with moderate to high fat infiltration at baseline show a larger increase over 
      time (+1.6%, p < 0.001). We did not find any changes in DTI parameters except for 
      low fat-infiltration muscles (m. adductor longus and m. biceps femoris (short 
      head)). The T(2) of muscles decreased from 28.2 ms to 28.0 ms (p = 0.07). Muscle 
      strength and motor function scores were not significantly different between 
      follow-up and baseline. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal imaging data show slow disease 
      progression in skeletal muscle of the thigh of (young-) adult patients with SMA 
      despite stable strength and motor function scores. Quantitative muscle imaging 
      demonstrates potential as a biomarker for disease activity and monitoring of 
      therapy response.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to clarify exercise-induced changes in intravoxel 
      incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters obtained from diffusion-weighted imaging 
      (DWI) of the calf muscle, as well as the relationships between IVIM parameters, 
      perfusion, and water content in muscle tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen 
      healthy volunteers underwent IVIM-DWI, arterial spin labeling (ASL), and 
      multi-echo spin-echo T(2) mapping of the right calf on a 3.0-T magnetic resonance 
      imaging scanner before and after performing dorsiflexion exercise. From the data, 
      we derived the perfusion-related diffusion coefficient (D(⁎)), perfusion 
      component fraction (F), blood flow parameter (FD(⁎)), and restricted diffusion 
      coefficient (D) in the tibialis anterior muscle. The muscle blood flow (MBF) and 
      transverse relaxation time (T(2)) were also calculated from the ASL and 
      multi-echo spin-echo data, respectively. We compared the parameters measured 
      before and after exercise and assessed the relationship of each IVIM-derived 
      perfusion parameter (D(⁎), F, and FD(⁎)) with MBF and each diffusion parameter (D 
      and ADC) or F with T(2). RESULTS: Notably, all these parameters were 
      significantly increased after exercise. Before exercise, the FD(⁎) exhibited a 
      significant positive correlation with the MBF, whereas no significant correlation 
      was observed between D(⁎) or F and MBF. After exercise, both D(⁎) and FD(⁎) 
      exhibited significant positive correlations with MBF, whereas F was not 
      significantly correlated with MBF. Additionally, D was significantly correlated 
      with T(2) after exercise, but not before exercise. No significant correlations 
      were found between ADC and T(2) either before or after exercise. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      IVIM analyses before and after exercise enable the simultaneous evaluation of 
      exercise-induced changes in perfusion and water diffusion in the muscle and 
      increases the body of information on muscle physiology.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of diffusion-weighted MR imaging at 3.0 T in predicting 
      muscle invasion in urinary bladder cancer: utility of evaluating the morphology 
      of the reactive tumor stalk.
PG  - 2431-2441
LID - 10.1007/s00261-018-1458-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of stalk morphology on 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in comparison with conventional MRI in 
      predicting muscle invasion in urinary bladder cancer. METHODS: The study was 
      prospective and approved by the institutional ethics committee. A written 
      informed consent was obtained from all the patients. The study included 56 
      patients who presented with bladder mass between January 2014 and November 2015. 
      After excluding 16 patients, 40 patients with 92 tumors were assessed. All the 40 
      patients underwent MRI at 3.0 Tesla (Achieva, Philips) inclusive of DWI (b0, 500, 
      1000 and 1500). Two radiologists evaluated the images independently, and 
      disparities were resolved through consensus. For predicting muscle invasion on 
      T2-weighted images, tumor morphology (papillary versus non-papillary), 
      distensibility of the underlying bladder wall, and perivesical fat infiltration 
      were evaluated. On DWI, the criterion used in a previous study (Takeuchi et al.) 
      was used along with tumor stalk morphology. Findings were compared with 
      histopathology using Pearson's χ(2) test, and diagnostic performance indices were 
      calculated. RESULTS: All the evaluated features were present with significantly 
      higher frequency in muscle-invasive tumors (p < 0.001). The finding of absent or 
      distorted stalk on DWI had the highest sensitivity (87.5%) and specificity 
      (97.6%). Conventional imaging features of non-papillary stalk morphology, 
      restricted distension of underlying bladder wall, perivesical fat infiltration, 
      as well as the previous DWI criterion were less sensitive (56.3%, 68.8%, 56.3% 
      and 56.3%, respectively) in predicting muscle invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment 
      of the morphology of the reactive tumor stalk on DWI has better diagnostic 
      performance in predicting muscle invasion than conventional MRI.

AB  - This paper introduces the meshfree Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM) for 
      3D image-based modeling of skeletal muscles. This approach allows for 
      construction of simulation model based on pixel data obtained from medical 
      images. The material properties and muscle fiber direction obtained from 
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) are input at each pixel point. The reproducing 
      kernel (RK) approximation allows a representation of material heterogeneity with 
      smooth transition. A multiphase multichannel level set based segmentation 
      framework is adopted for individual muscle segmentation using Magnetic Resonance 
      Images (MRI) and DTI. The application of the proposed methods for modeling the 
      human lower leg is demonstrated.

TI  - Detecting Muscle Invasion of Bladder Cancer Using a Proposed Magnetic Resonance 
      Imaging Strategy.
PG  - 1212-1221
LID - 10.1002/jmri.27676 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate evaluation of the invasion depth of tumors with a Vesical 
      Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) score of 3 is difficult. PURPOSE: To 
      evaluate the diagnostic performance of a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      strategy based on the integration of the VI-RADS and tumor contact length (TCL) 
      for the diagnosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). STUDY TYPE: Single 
      center, retrospective. SUBJECTS: A group of 179 patients with a mean age of 
      67 years (range, 24.0-96.0) underwent multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) before surgery, 
      including 147 (82.1%) males and 32 (17.9%) females. Twenty-four (13.4%), 90 
      (50.3%), 43 (24.0%), 15 (8.4%), and 7 (3.9%) cases were Ta, T1, T2, T3, and T4, 
      respectively. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 1.5 T and 3.0 T, T2-weighted turbo 
      spin-echo (TSE), single-shot echo-planar (SS-EPI), diffusion-weighted imaging 
      (DWI), and T1-weighted volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (T1-VIBE). 
      ASSESSMENT: Three radiologists independently graded the VI-RADS score and 
      measured the TCL on index lesion images. A proposed MRI strategy called 
      VI-RADS_TCL was introduced by modifying the VI-RADS score, which was downgraded 
      to VI-RADS 3F (equal to a VI-RADS score of 2) if VI-RADS = 3 and TCL < 3 cm. 
      STATISTICAL TESTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Mann-Whitney U 
      test, chi-square tests, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and 2 × 2 
      contingency tables were applied. RESULTS: Inter-reader agreement values were 
      0.941 (95% CI, 0.924-0.955) and 0.934 (95% CI, 0.916-0.948) for the TCL and 
      VI-RADS score. The TCL was significantly increased in the MIBC group 
      (6.40-6.85 cm) compared with the NMIBC group (1.98-2.45 cm) (P < 0.05). The 
      specificity and positive predictive values (PPV) of VI-RADS_TCL were 
      82.46%-87.72% and 90.91%-91.59%, which were significantly greater than VI-RADS 
      score (P < 0.05). Additionally, 52.17%-55.88% NMIBC lesions with VI-RADS 3 were 
      downgraded to 3F by using VI-RADS_TCL. DATA CONCLUSION: The proposed MRI strategy 
      could reduce the false-positive rate of lesions with a VI-RADS score of 3 while 
      retaining sensitivity. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 4 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: 2.

TI  - MRI in acute muscle tears in athletes: can quantitative T2 and DTI predict return 
      to play better than visual assessment?
PG  - 6603-6613
LID - 10.1007/s00330-020-06999-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the ability of quantitative T2, diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) and radiologist's scores to detect muscle changes following acute muscle 
      tear in soccer and rugby players. To assess the ability of these parameters to 
      predict return to play times. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study, 
      13 male athletes (age 19 to 34 years; mean 25 years) underwent MRI within 1 week 
      of suffering acute muscle tear. Imaging included measurements of T2 and DTI 
      parameters. Images were also assessed using modified Peetrons and British 
      athletics muscle injury classification (BAMIC) scores. Participants returned for 
      a second scan within 1 week of being determined fit to return to play. MRI 
      measurements were compared between visits. Pearson's correlation between visit 1 
      measurements and return to play times was assessed. RESULTS: There were 
      significant differences between visits in BAMIC scores (Z = - 2.088; p = 0.037), 
      modified Peetrons (Z = - 2.530; p = 0.011) and quantitative MRI measurements; T2, 
      13.12 ms (95% CI, 4.82 ms, 21.42 ms; p = 0.01); mean diffusivity (0.22 (0.04, 
      0.39); p = 0.02) and fractional anisotropy (0.07 (0.01, 0.14); p = 0.03). BAMIC 
      scores showed a significant correlation with return to play time (R(s) = 0.64; 
      p = 0.02), but modified Peetrons scores and quantitative parameters did not. 
      CONCLUSIONS: T2 and DTI measurements in muscle can detect changes due to healing 
      following muscle tear. Although BAMIC scores correlated well with return to play 
      times, in this small study, quantitative MRI values did not, suggesting that T2 
      and DTI measurements are inferior predictors of return to play time compared with 
      visual scoring. KEY POINTS: • Muscle changes following acute muscle tear can be 
      measured using T2 and diffusion measurements on MRI. • Measurements of T2 and 
      diffusion using MRI are not as good as a radiologist's visual report at 
      predicting return to play time after acute muscle tear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The masseter muscle has a complicated multipennate internal structure 
      and exhibits functional differentiation when performing various stomatognathic 
      functions. It is important to understand the internal structural changes of the 
      muscle during functioning to elucidate characteristic muscle disorders such as 
      local myalgia. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may be useful for investigating the 
      internal structural features of muscle. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the features of 
      masseter muscle fibres in human participants using DTI fibre tractography, and to 
      elucidate the structural differences in the masseter muscle between the 
      mandibular rest and open positions. METHODS: Five healthy men (age 31 ± 7 years) 
      underwent DTI and T1-weighted MRI of the right masseter muscle in the mandibular 
      rest and open positions. MR images were used as a reference for muscle layer 
      segmentation (superficial, intermediate, and deep). DTI fibre tractography of the 
      masseter muscle was performed and the orientation of the DTI fibres was analysed 
      in each layer using coordinates based on the Frankfurt horizontal plane. RESULTS: 
      The DTI fibre orientation of the deep layer significantly changed between the 
      mandibular rest and open positions in the frontal plane (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank 
      sum test). However, no significant change was found in the superficial and 
      intermediate layers. CONCLUSION: DTI fibre tractography confirmed regional 
      differences in the orientation change of the masseter muscle fibres between 
      different mandibular positions. The results may support the existence of 
      functional partitioning inside the masseter muscle and suggest that DTI may be 
      useful for the evaluation of muscle fibres in multipennate muscles.

PG  - 673-81
AB  - Diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) offers great potential for 
      understanding structure-function relationships in human skeletal muscles. The 
      purposes of this study were to demonstrate the feasibility of using in vivo human 
      DT-MRI fiber tracking data for making pennation angle measurements and to test 
      the hypothesis that heterogeneity in the orientation of the tibialis anterior 
      (TA) muscle's aponeurosis would lead to heterogeneity in pennation angle. Eight 
      healthy subjects (5 male) were studied. T(1)-weighted anatomical MRI and DT-MRI 
      data were acquired of the TA muscle. Fibers were tracked from the TA's 
      aponeurosis by following the principal eigenvector. The orientations of the 
      aponeurosis and muscle fiber tracts in the laboratory frame of reference and the 
      orientation of the fiber tracts with respect to the aponeurosis [i.e., the 
      pennation angle (theta)] were determined. The muscle fiber orientations, when 
      expressed relative to the laboratory frame of reference, did not change as 
      functions of superior-to-inferior position. The sagittal and coronal orientations 
      of the aponeurosis did not change in practically significant manners either, but 
      the aponeurosis' axial orientation changed by approximately 40 degrees . As a 
      result, the mean value for theta decreased from 16.3 (SD 6.9) to 11.4 degrees (SD 
      5.0) along the muscle's superior-to-inferior direction. The mean value of theta 
      was greater in the deep than in the superficial compartment. We conclude that 
      pennation angle measurements of human muscle made using DT-MRI muscle fiber 
      tracking are feasible and reveal that in the foot-head direction, there is 
      heterogeneity in the pennation properties of the human TA muscle.

TI  - Diffusion tensor MRI to assess skeletal muscle disruption following eccentric 
      exercise.
PG  - 42-50

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Structural evidence of exercise-induced muscle disruption has 
      traditionally involved histological analysis of muscle tissue obtained by needle 
      biopsy, however, there are multiple limitations with this technique. Recently, 
      diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) has been successfully 
      demonstrated to noninvasively assess skeletal muscle abnormalities induced by 
      traumatic injury. METHODS: To determine the potential for DT-MRI to detect 
      musculoskeletal changes after a bout of eccentric exercise, 10 healthy men 
      performed 300 eccentric actions on an isokinetic dynamometer. DT-MRI measurements 
      and muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were obtained before and 24 h 
      post-exercise. RESULTS: Z-band streaming was higher 24 h post-exercise compared 
      with baseline (P < 0.05). The histological indices of damage coincided with 
      changes in DT-MRI parameters of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion 
      coefficient; reflecting altered skeletal muscle geometry (P < 0.05). Z-band 
      streaming quantified per fiber correlated with FA (r = -0.512; P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: DT-MRI can detect changes in human skeletal muscle structure 
      following eccentric exercise.

TI  - Diffusion-tensor MRI reveals the complex muscle architecture of the human 
      forearm.
PG  - 237-48
LID - 10.1002/jmri.23608 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To design a time-efficient patient-friendly clinical diffusion tensor 
      MRI protocol and postprocessing tool to study the complex muscle architecture of 
      the human forearm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 15-minute examination was done 
      using a 3 T system and consisted of: T(1) -weighted imaging, dual echo gradient 
      echo imaging, single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) diffusion tensor 
      MRI. Postprocessing comprised of signal-to-noise improvement by a Rician noise 
      suppression algorithm, image registration to correct for motion and eddy 
      currents, and correction of susceptibility-induced deformations using magnetic 
      field inhomogeneity maps. Per muscle one to five regions of interest were used 
      for fiber tractography seeding. To validate our approach, the reconstructions of 
      individual muscles from the in vivo scans were compared to photographs of those 
      dissected from a human cadaver forearm. RESULTS: Postprocessing proved essential 
      to allow muscle segmentation based on combined T(1) -weighted and diffusion 
      tensor data. The protocol can be applied more generally to study human muscle 
      architecture in other parts of the body. CONCLUSION: The proposed protocol was 
      able to visualize the muscle architecture of the human forearm in great detail 
      and showed excellent agreement with the dissected cadaver muscles.

TI  - Role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in predicting sensitivity 
      to chemoradiotherapy in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
PG  - e21-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.11.065 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In chemoradiation (CRT)-based bladder-sparing approaches for muscle 
      invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), patients who respond favorably to induction CRT 
      enjoy the benefits of bladder preservation, whereas nonresponders do not. Thus, 
      accurate prediction of CRT sensitivity would optimize patient selection for 
      bladder-sparing protocols. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is a functional 
      imaging technique that quantifies the diffusion of water molecules in a 
      noninvasive manner. We investigated whether DW-MRI predicts CRT sensitivity of 
      MIBC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohort consisted of 23 MIBC patients 
      (cT2/T3 = 7/16) who underwent induction CRT consisting of radiotherapy to the 
      small pelvis (40 Gy) with two cycles of cisplatin (20 mg/day for 5 days), 
      followed by partial or radical cystectomy. All patients underwent DW-MRI before 
      the initiation of treatment. Associations of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 
      values with CRT sensitivity were analyzed. The proliferative potential of MIBC 
      was also assessed by analyzing the Ki-67 labeling index (LI) in pretherapeutic 
      biopsy specimens. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (57%) achieved pathologic complete 
      response (pCR) to CRT. These CRT-sensitive MIBCs showed significantly lower ADC 
      values (median, 0.63 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; range, 0.43-0.77) than CRT-resistant (no 
      pCR) MIBCs (median, 0.84 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; range, 0.69-1.09; p = 0.0003). 
      Multivariate analysis identified ADC value as the only significant and 
      independent predictor of CRT sensitivity (p < 0.0001; odds ratio per 0.001 
      ×10(-3) mm(2)/s increase, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.08). With a 
      cutoff ADC value at 0.74 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, sensitivity/specificity/accuracy in 
      predicting CRT sensitivity was 92/90/91%. Ki-67 LI was significantly higher in 
      CRT-sensitive MIBCs (p = 0.0005) and significantly and inversely correlated with 
      ADC values (ρ = -0.67, p = 0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: DW-MRI is a potential biomarker 
      for predicting CRT sensitivity in MIBC. DW-MRI may be useful to optimize patient 
      selection for CRT-based bladder-sparing approaches.

TI  - Extracting skeletal muscle fiber fields from noisy diffusion tensor data.
PG  - 340-53
LID - 10.1016/j.media.2011.01.005 [doi]
AB  - Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) allows the non-invasive study of muscle fiber 
      architecture but musculoskeletal DTI suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio. 
      Noise in the computed tensor fields can lead to poorly reconstructed muscle fiber 
      fields. This paper describes an algorithm for producing denoised muscle fiber 
      fields from noisy diffusion tensor data as well as its preliminary validation. 
      The algorithm computes a denoised vector field by finding the components of its 
      Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition that optimally match the diffusion tensor field. A 
      key feature of the algorithm is that it performs denoising of the vector field 
      simultaneously with its extraction from the noisy tensor field. This allows the 
      vector field reconstruction to be constrained by the architectural properties of 
      skeletal muscles. When compared to primary eigenvector fields extracted from 
      noisy synthetic data, the denoised vector fields show greater similarity to the 
      ground truth for signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 20 to 5. Similarity greater 
      than 0.9 (in terms of fiber direction) is observed for all signal-to-noise 
      ratios, for smoothing parameter values greater than or equal to 10 (larger values 
      yield more smoothing). Fiber architectures were computed from human forearm 
      diffusion tensor data using extracted primary eigenvectors and the denoised data. 
      Qualitative comparison of the fiber fields showed that the denoised fields were 
      anatomically more plausible than the noisy fields. From the results of 
      experiments using both synthetic and real MR datasets we conclude that the 
      denoising algorithm produces anatomically plausible fiber architectures from 
      diffusion tensor images with a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.

TI  - Effects of different cooling treatments on water diffusion, microcirculation, and 
      water content within exercised muscles: evaluation by magnetic resonance 
      T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging.
PG  - 1157-63

AB  - In this study, we determined the effects of different cooling treatments on 
      exercised muscles. Seven adults underwent four post-exercise treatments (20-min 
      ice-bag application, 60-min gel-pack application at 10 degrees C and 17 degrees 
      C, and non-cooling treatment) with at least 1 week between treatments. Magnetic 
      resonance diffusion- and T2-weighted images were obtained to calculate the 
      apparent diffusion coefficients (apparent diffusion coefficient 1, which reflects 
      intramuscular water diffusion and microcirculation, and apparent diffusion 
      coefficient 2, which is approximately equal to the true diffusion coefficient 
      that excludes as much of the effect of intramuscular microcirculation as 
      possible) and the T2 values (intramuscular water content level) of the ankle 
      dorsiflexors, respectively, before and after ankle dorsiflexion exercise and 
      after post-exercise treatment. The T2 values increased significantly after 
      exercise and returned to pre-exercise values after each treatment; no significant 
      differences were observed among the four post-exercise treatments. Both apparent 
      diffusion coefficients also increased significantly after exercise and decreased 
      significantly after the three cooling treatments; no significant difference was 
      detected among the three cooling treatments. Local cooling suppresses both water 
      diffusion and microcirculation within exercised muscles. Moreover, although the 
      treatment time was longer, adequate cooling effects could be achieved using the 
      gel-pack applications at relatively mild cooling temperatures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of magnetic resonance dynamic contrast-enhanced 
      (MR-DCE) and magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (MR-DWI) in the 
      differentiation of benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors. METHODS: 
      Sixty-three patients with pathologically confirmed musculoskeletal tumors were 
      examined with MR-DCE and MR-DWI. Using single shot spin echo planar imaging 
      sequence and different b values of 400, 600, 800 and 1000 s/mm(2), we obtained 
      the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the lesions. ADC values were measured 
      before and after MR-DCE, with a b value of 600 s/mm(2). The 3D fast acquired 
      multiple phase enhanced fast spoiled gradient recalled echo sequence was obtained 
      for multi-slice of the entire lesion. The time-signal intensity curve (TIC), 
      dynamic contrast-enhanced parameters, maximum slope of increase (MSI), positive 
      enhancement integral, signal enhancement ratio, and time to peak (T(peak)) were 
      also recorded. RESULTS: ADC showed no significant difference between benign and 
      malignant tumors when the b value was 400, 600, 800, or 1000 s/mm(2), and it was 
      not significantly different between benign and malignant tumors in both 
      pre-MR-DCE and post-MR-DCE with b value of 600 s/mm(2). TIC were classified into 
      four types type1 showed rapid progression and gradual drainage; type2 showed 
      rapid progression but had no or slight progression; type 3 showed gradual 
      progression; and type 4 had no or slight progression. Most lesions of type1 or 
      type2 were malignant, whereas most lesions of type 3 or type 4 were benign. When 
      using type1 and type 2 as the standards of malignancy, the diagnostic sensitivity 
      and specificity was 87.23% and 50.00%, respectively. The types of TIC showed 
      significant difference between benign and malignant musculoskeletal 
      tumors(χ(2)=17.009,P=0.001). When using MSI 366.62 ± 174.84 as the standard of 
      malignancy, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was 86.78% and 78.67%, 
      respectively. When using T(peak)≤70s as the standard of malignancy, the 
      diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was 82.89%and 85.78%, respectively. 
      Positive enhancement integral and signal enhancement ratio showed no significant 
      difference between benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors. CONCLUSIONS: TIC, 
      MSI and T(peak) of MR-DCE are valuable in differentiating benign from malignant 
      musculoskeletal tumors. T(peak) has the highest diagnostic specificity, and TIC 
      has the highest diagnostic sensitivity. The mean ADC value are no significant 
      difference between benign and malignant tumors.

AB  - Capillaries are the most basic and important blood vessel of the circulatory 
      systems. The evaluation of the blood flow may contribute to many studies in 
      future. We evaluated the capillary blood flow change of lower limb muscle over 
      time before and after the exercise used by magnetic resonance imaging-intravoxel 
      incoherent motion (MRI-IVIM) obtained perfusion information. Furthermore, we 
      examined an association between the muscle pain after the exercise and the 
      diffusion weighted image (DWI) indexes. DWI was imaged using multi-b values for a 
      thigh and calf muscles. MRI was performed just after an exercise test, 3, 6, and 
      24 hours later, and the IVIM index and diffusion index were calculated. 
      Furthermore, we interviewed the degree of the muscle ache 24 hours later. As a 
      result, pseudo diffusion coefficient (D*) and f value as IVIM index increased 
      after-exercise as compared with pre-exercise and decreased in 3 hours later. A 
      similar tendency was found in the apparent diffusion coefficient and the 
      diffusion coefficient as diffusion index. Furthermore, all indexes increased in 
      after exercise from before exercise and decreased with time passed and increased 
      again 24 hours later. In conclusion, IVIM could obtain capillary blood flow 
      information, and it was suggested to contribute for sports medicine in future.

TI  - Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness: Temporal Assessment With Quantitative MRI and

PG  - 402-412
LID - 10.2214/AJR.16.16617 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess delayed-onset muscle soreness 
      (DOMS) over time using quantitative MRI and shear-wave ultrasound (US) 
      elastography. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Five male (mean age ± SD, 39.6 ± 4.6 years) 
      and five female (30.6 ± 13.5 years) volunteers underwent 1.5-T MRI before and 
      after (15 minutes, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days) performing unilateral eccentric 
      resistance exercise of the elbow flexor muscles. The MRI examinations included 
      fluid-sensitive, DWI, and diffusion-tensor imaging sequences of the distal upper 
      arm. Muscle edema, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) were assessed. US of the brachialis muscle was performed before 
      and after (15 minutes, 12 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 7 days) exercise to 
      measure mean shear-wave velocity (SWV). Pain and muscle tightness were assessed. 
      RESULTS: For men, muscle edema was moderate and peaked 3 days after exercise; for 
      women, muscle edema was mild and peaked 1-3 days after exercise. ADC was highest 
      3 days after exercise in men (mean, 1809.22 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s; before exercise, 
      1529.88 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s) and women (1741.90 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s; before exercise, 
      1475.80 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s). FA dropped from 361.00 in men and 389.00 in women 
      before exercise to a minimum of 252.12 and 321.28, respectively, 3 days after 
      exercise. Mean SWV increased after exercise in men (before exercise, 3.00 ± 0.30 
      m/s; peak [15 minutes after exercise], 4.04 ± 0.90 m/s) and women (before, 2.82 ± 
      0.40 m/s; peak [1 day after exercise], 3.23 ± 0.40 m/s) and subsequently returned 
      to normal. In men, the ADC values of the brachialis muscle positively correlated 
      with mean SWV (r = 0.92, p = 0.028). FA negatively correlated with pain in men (r 
      = -0.993, p = 0.001) Muscle edema outlasted clinical symptoms in most volunteers. 
      CONCLUSION: FA inversely correlates with pain and may be a useful imaging 
      parameter for assessment of DOMS. Shear-wave US elastography shows a temporary 
      increase of muscle stiffness after DOMS-inducing exercise but does not correlate 
      with quantitative MRI parameters or clinical symptoms.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Preoperative staging of bladder cancer using imaging methods has 
      serious limitations. The accuracy of the abdominal diffusion-weighted magnetic 
      resonance (DW-MRI) to predict residual muscle invasion, perivesical and/or lymph 
      node affectation in the cystectomy specimen is evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 
      prospective study was performed on 20 patients with high grade muscle invasive 
      bladder cancer who received transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) in a 
      period of <1 month. The DW-MRI was performed before the radical cystectomy and 
      the radiologist predicted muscle invasion, extravesical affectation and lymph 
      node affectation, being blind to the histopathological study. Sensitivity (S), 
      specificity (sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value 
      (NPV) and accuracy (Ac) of the test were analyzed. The medians of the apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) value (Mann-Whitney) were compared and the ROC curves 
      study for DW-MRI and ADC was carried out. RESULTS: Distribution by categories 
      was: pT0 1(5%), pT1 6(30%), pT2 2(10%), pT3 8(40%) and pT4 3(15%). There was 
      agreement in the T-pT assignment in 17(85%). In 7(35%) there was lymph node 
      affectation (pN1-2). Consistency of the DW-MRI for muscle affectation was k=.89 
      (CI .67-1; S=1.0, Sp=,86, PPV=.93, NPV=1.0, Ac=.95), for perivesical fat 
      affectation k=.6 (CI .25-.95; S=.8, Sp=.8, PPV=.8, NPV=.8, Ac=.8) and for lymph 
      node affectation k=.89 (CI .67-1; S=.86, Sp=1.0, PPV=1.0, NPV=.93, Ac=.95). Mean 
      value of ADC was greater in G2 tumors (OMS1987) compared to G3 (p=.08). 
      Evaluation of DW-MRI imaging and ADC numerical value showed equivalent areas 
      under the curve for muscle (.93 and .9; Z=.7), fat (.8 and .91; Z=.31) and lymph 
      node (.93 and .97; Z=.36) affectation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: DW-MRI allows 
      for good pre-operative evaluation of the patient who is a candidate for 
      cystectomy, especially for the prediction of muscle (<pT2 vs ≥pT2) and/or lymph 
      node (N0 vs N1-2) affectation. Both are key points to choice the therapeutic 
      attitude after the bladder TURB. Furthermore, the ADC coefficient also predicts 
      tumor differentiation grade.

AB  - Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the performance of the 
      apparent diffusion coefficient in the detection of involvement of the medial and 
      lateral rectus muscles in patients with Graves' orbitopathy. Methods and 
      materials This prospective study was conducted on 33 consecutive patients (16 
      males, 17 females with a mean age of 36 years) with Graves' orbitopathy and 18 
      age- and sex-matched volunteers. The patients and volunteers underwent 
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit in the axial plane 
      using echo-planar imaging. The apparent diffusion coefficient of the medial and 
      lateral rectus muscles was calculated. Results The medial rectus muscle was more 
      affected than the lateral rectus muscle. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient 
      value of the medial and lateral rectus muscles was 1.81 ± 0.19 and 
      1.72 ± 0.07 × 10(-3 )mm(2)/s in patients with Graves' orbitopathy and 1.59 ± 0.06 
      and 1.51 ± 0.06 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in volunteers, respectively. There was a 
      significant difference in apparent diffusion coefficient values of the medial and 
      lateral rectus muscles between patients with Graves' orbitopathy and volunteers ( 
      p = 0.001). The classification performance as measured with area under the 
      receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 
      0.732-0.904). The best performing threshold of the apparent diffusion coefficient 
      value of the medial rectus muscle was 1.69 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s and associated 
      efficiency was 86%, sensitivity was 97%, and specificity was 97%. Conclusion We 
      concluded that the apparent diffusion coefficient of the medial rectus muscle can 
      be used for diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the effect of anisotropic smoothing on fiber tracking 
      measures, including pennation angle, fiber tract length, and fiber tract number 
      in the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle in healthy subjects using 
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3T 
      DW-MRI data were used for muscle fiber tractography in the MG of healthy 
      subjects. Anisotropic smoothing was applied at three levels (5%, 10%, 15%), and 
      pennation angle, tract length, fiber tract number, fractional anisotropy, and 
      principal eigenvector orientation were quantified for each smoothing level. 
      RESULTS: Fiber tract length increased with pre-fiber tracking smoothing, and 
      local heterogeneities in fiber direction were reduced. However, pennation angle 
      was not affected by smoothing. CONCLUSION: Modest anisotropic smoothing (10%) 
      improved fiber-tracking results, while preserving structural features.

TI  - Combined diffusion and strain tensor MRI reveals a heterogeneous, planar pattern 
      of strain development during isometric muscle contraction.
PG  - R1079-90
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.00474.2010 [doi]
AB  - The purposes of this study were to create a three-dimensional representation of 
      strain during isometric contraction in vivo and to interpret it with respect to 
      the muscle fiber direction. Diffusion tensor MRI was used to measure the muscle 
      fiber direction of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of seven healthy volunteers. 
      Spatial-tagging MRI was used to measure linear strains in six directions during 
      separate 50% maximal isometric contractions of the TA. The strain tensor (E) was 
      computed in the TA's deep and superficial compartments and compared with the 
      respective diffusion tensors. Diagonalization of E revealed a planar strain 
      pattern, with one nonzero negative strain (ε(N)) and one nonzero positive strain 
      (ε(P)); both strains were larger in magnitude (P < 0.05) in the deep compartment 
      [ε(N) = -40.4 ± 4.3%, ε(P) = 35.1 ± 3.5% (means ± SE)] than in the superficial 
      compartment (ε(N) = -24.3 ± 3.9%, ε(P) = 6.3 ± 4.9%). The principal shortening 
      direction deviated from the fiber direction by 24.0 ± 1.3° and 39.8 ± 6.1° in the 
      deep and superficial compartments, respectively (P < 0.05, deep vs. superficial). 
      The deviation of the shortening direction from the fiber direction was due 
      primarily to the lower angle of elevation of the shortening direction over the 
      axial plane than that of the fiber direction. It is concluded that 
      three-dimensional analyses of strain interpreted with respect to the fiber 
      architecture are necessary to characterize skeletal muscle contraction in vivo. 
      The deviation of the principal shortening direction from the fiber direction may 
      relate to intramuscle variations in fiber length and pennation angle.

TI  - Clinical application of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging in skeletal 
      muscle.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is increasingly applied in the 
      detection and characterization of skeletal muscle. This promising technique has 
      aroused much enthusiasm and generated high expectations, because it is able to 
      provide some specific information of skeletal muscle that is not available from 
      other imaging modalities. Compared with conventional MRI, DTI could reconstruct 
      the trajectories of skeletal muscle fibers. It makes it possible to 
      non-invasively detect several physiological values (diffusion values), like 
      fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which have a 
      great association with the muscle physiology and pathology. Furthermore, other 
      advantages of DTI are the capability of investigating the muscle biomechanics and 
      also investigate the pathological condition of skeletal muscle. Finally, several 
      challenges, which limit the wide application of DTI in skeletal muscle, were 
      discussed. It is believed that this review may arouse in-depth studies on the 
      clinical application of DTI in skeletal muscle in future.

TI  - In vivo imaging of the time-dependent apparent diffusional kurtosis in the human 
      calf muscle.
PG  - 1581-90
LID - 10.1002/jmri.24743 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the time dependency of apparent diffusion coefficient Dapp 
      and apparent diffusional kurtosis Kapp in vivo in the human calf. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Diffusion-weighted images of five healthy male volunteers were acquired 
      using a 1.5T MR scanner. A stimulated echo sequence with echo planar imaging 
      readout was used with diffusion gradients oriented along the three main axes. 
      Mixing times (TM) of 100, 300, 500, and 700 ms and b-values ranging from 0 to 
      5600 s/mm(2) were used. Dapp and Kapp were determined. RESULTS: Dapp and Kapp 
      decreased with increasing TM. As an example for absolute values, Dapp of the 
      tibialis anterior drops from 1.18 ± 0.04 μm(2) /ms (TM = 100 ms) to 0.86 ± 0.02 
      μm(2) /ms (TM = 700 ms) (P = 0.001) and Kapp from 0.38 ± 0.06 to 0.32 ± 0.03 (P = 
      0.046) for a diffusion weighting along the left-right direction. Kapp was smaller 
      than 0.43 in all muscles and at all TMs. CONCLUSION: The clearly observed 
      time-dependence of Dapp and Kapp is an indicator of restricted diffusion in 
      muscle tissue and may thus be a promising marker to investigate alterations of 
      the microstructure. Compared to typical kurtosis values in white matter tissue of 
      the brain, the kurtosis in muscle tissue is much smaller, which we attribute to 
      the absence of the almost impermeable myelin sheath.

TI  - Diffusion fractional anisotropy-based transformation in skeletal muscle caused by 
      pressure.
PG  - 179-84
AB  - PURPOSE: We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate anisotropic changes 
      in skeletal muscle cells under external pressure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 6 
      healthy volunteers, we compared DTI of the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus 
      (SOL) muscles under pressure. We performed imaging using a 1.5-tesla magnetic 
      resonance (MR) scanner and diffusion-weighted stimulated-echo echo-planar pulse 
      sequences optimized for skeletal muscle. We calculated diffusion tensor 
      eigenvalues (λ), apparent diffusion coefficients, and fractional anisotropy (FA) 
      values in a series of axially acquired DTI and compared them between the 
      pressurized and nonpressurized lower limbs. We also measured a cross-sectional 
      area of skeletal muscle. RESULTS: We observed clear differences in FA and λ₃ 
      between pressurized muscles and the nonpressurized muscles we used as controls. 
      The mean control FAs were 0.36±0.02 (TA) and 0.30±0.02 (SOL). The mean control 
      λ₃s were 0.74±0.02 s/mm² (TA) and 0.85±0.03 s/mm² (SOL). FA values in the 
      pressurized (200 mmHg) limbs increased to 0.39±0.02 (TA) and 0.35±0.04 (SOL) 
      compared with those values in the nonpressurized controls. λ₃ values in the 
      pressurized (200 mmHg) limbs decreased to 0.68±0.05 s/mm² (TA) and 0.77±0.06 
      s/mm² (SOL) compared with those in controls. Moreover, the mean value of 
      cross-sectional area of skeletal muscle (control) was 907.3±140.1 mm² (TA) and 
      1522±201.0 mm² (SOL). The cross-sectional area in the pressurized (200 mmHg) 
      limbs decreased to 590.3±68.1 mm² (TA) and 1131±112.6 mm² (SOL) compared with 
      those in controls. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Tukey-Kramer 
      tests showed significant differences. CONCLUSION: Anisotropy changed markedly on 
      pressurizing the lower limb based on the correlation of the cross-sectional area 
      and λ₃ suggested marked changed in anisotropy following application of pressure 
      to the lower limb. If compression of the cross-sectional area is assumed to 
      represent compression of the cell, change in λ₃ reflected the change in the size 
      of muscle cells.

AB  - Localised signal voids in diffusion-weighted (DW) images of skeletal muscle have 
      been postulated to occur as a result of muscle fibre contraction and relaxation. 
      We investigated the contrast mechanism of these signal voids using a combination 
      of modelling and experimental measurements by employing DW and phase contrast 
      (PC) imaging sequences. The DW signal and PC signal were simulated for each time 
      point of a theoretical muscle twitch. The model incorporated compaction 
      (simulating actively contracting muscle fibres) and translation (simulating 
      passively moving surrounding fibres). The model suggested that the DW signal 
      depended on contraction time and compaction whereas the PC signal depended on 
      contraction time, compaction and translation. In a retrospective study, we tested 
      this model with subgroup analyses on 10 healthy participants. Electrical nerve 
      stimulation was used to generate muscle twitches in lower leg muscles; the 
      resulting force was measured using an MR-compatible force transducer. At current 
      levels causing a visible muscle twitch (~13 mA), the width of the first signal 
      drop in the DW signal (mean ± SD: 103 ± 20 ms) was comparable with the force 
      contraction time (93 ± 34 ms; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.717, P 
      = .010). At current levels activating single motor units (~9 mA), the contraction 
      time determined from the DW signal was 75 ± 13 ms and comparable with the PC 
      contraction time (81 ± 15 ms; ICC = 0.925, P = .001). The maximum positive 
      velocity was 0.55 ± 0.26 cm/s and the displacement was 0.20 ± 0.10 mm. Voxel-wise 
      analysis revealed localised DW changes occurring together with more widespread 
      phase changes. In conclusion, local signal attenuations in DW images following 
      muscle fibre activation are primarily caused by compaction. The PC sequence also 
      detects translating muscle tissue being passively pulled. The magnitude of the 
      changes in DW and PC images depends on the twitch's contractile properties and 
      percentage contraction. DW imaging and PC imaging can therefore measure twitch 
      profiles of skeletal muscle fibres.

TI  - Quantification and Monitoring of the Effect of Botulinum Toxin A on Paretic Calf 
      Muscles of Children With Cerebral Palsy With MRI: A Preliminary Study.
PG  - 630435
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2021.630435 [doi]
LID - 630435
AB  - Background: Muscles from patients with cerebral palsy (CP) are often spastic and 
      form contractures that limit the range of motion. Injections of botulinum toxin A 
      (BTX) into the calf muscles are an important treatment for functional equinus; 
      however, improvement in gait function is not always achieved. BTX is also used to 
      test muscle weakening for risk evaluation of muscle lengthening surgery. Our aim 
      was to assess the effect of BTX over time on calf muscle properties in pediatric 
      CP patients with MRI. Material and Methods: Six toe-walking CP patients (mean age 
      11.6 years) with indication for lengthening surgery were prospectively enrolled 
      and received BTX injections into the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. MRI scans 
      at 3T of the lower legs and clinical examinations were performed pre-BTX, 6 weeks 
      (6w), and 12 weeks (12w) post-BTX. A fat-suppressed 2D multi-spin-echo sequence 
      was used to acquire T(2) maps and for segmentation. Fat fraction maps were 
      calculated from 3D multi-echo Dixon images. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with a 
      2D echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence yielded maps of the mean apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) and of the fractional anisotropy (FA). Hyperintense regions of 
      interest (ROIs) on the T(2)-weighted (T(2)w) images at 6w were segmented in 
      treated muscles. Mean values of T(2), fat fraction, ADC, and FA were calculated 
      in hyperintense ROIs and in reference ROIs in non-treated muscles. Results: 
      Hyperintensity on T(2)w scans and increased T(2) (group mean ± standard 
      deviation: 35 ± 1 ms pre-BTX, 45 ± 2 ms at 6w, and 44 ± 2 ms at 12w) were 
      observed in all patients at the injection sites. The T(2) increase was spatially 
      limited to parts of the injected muscles. FA increased (0.30 ± 0.03 pre-BTX, 0.34 
      ± 0.02 at 6w, and 0.36 ± 0.03 at 12w) while ADC did not change in hyperintense 
      ROIs, indicating a BTX-induced increase in extracellular space and a simultaneous 
      decrease of muscle fiber diameter. Fat fraction showed a trend for increase at 
      12w. Mean values in reference ROIs remained unchanged. Conclusion: MRI showed 
      limited spatial distribution of the BTX-induced effects in pediatric CP patients. 
      It could be a promising non-invasive tool for future studies to test BTX 
      treatment protocols.

TI  - (*) A 3D Tissue-Printing Approach for Validation of Diffusion Tensor Imaging in 
      Skeletal Muscle.
PG  - 980-988
LID - 10.1089/ten.tea.2016.0438 [doi]
AB  - The ability to noninvasively assess skeletal muscle microstructure, which 
      predicts function and disease, would be of significant clinical value. One method 
      that holds this promise is diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI), 
      which is sensitive to the microscopic diffusion of water within tissues and has 
      become ubiquitous in neuroimaging as a way of assessing neuronal structure and 
      damage. However, its application to the assessment of changes in muscle 
      microstructure associated with injury, pathology, or age remains poorly defined, 
      because it is difficult to precisely control muscle microstructural features in 
      vivo. However, recent advances in additive manufacturing technologies allow 
      precision-engineered diffusion phantoms with histology informed skeletal muscle 
      geometry to be manufactured. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop 
      skeletal muscle phantoms at relevant size scales to relate microstructural 
      features to MRI-based diffusion measurements. A digital light projection based 
      rapid 3D printing method was used to fabricate polyethylene glycol diacrylate 
      based diffusion phantoms with (1) idealized muscle geometry (no geometry; fiber 
      sizes of 30, 50, or 70 μm or fiber size of 50 μm with 40% of walls randomly 
      deleted) or (2) histology-based geometry (normal and after 30-days of 
      denervation) containing 20% or 50% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mean absolute 
      percent error (8%) of the printed phantoms indicated high conformity to templates 
      when "fibers" were >50 μm. A multiple spin-echo echo planar imaging diffusion 
      sequence, capable of acquiring diffusion weighted data at several echo times, was 
      used in an attempt to combine relaxometry and diffusion techniques with the goal 
      of separating intracellular and extracellular diffusion signals. When fiber size 
      increased (30-70 μm) in the 20% PBS phantom, fractional anisotropy (FA) decreased 
      (0.32-0.26) and mean diffusivity (MD) increased (0.44 × 10(-3) 
      mm(2)/s-0.70 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s). Similarly, when fiber size increased from 30 to 
      70 μm in the 50% PBS diffusion phantoms, a small change in FA was observed 
      (0.18-0.22), but MD increased from 0.86 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s to 1.79 × 10(-3) 
      mm(2)/s. This study demonstrates a novel application of tissue engineering to 
      understand complex diffusion signals in skeletal muscle. Through this work, we 
      have also demonstrated the feasibility of 3D printing for skeletal muscle with 
      relevant matrix geometries and physiologically relevant tissue characteristics.

TI  - Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System for Multiparametric MRI to Predict the 
      Presence of Muscle Invasion for Bladder Cancer.
PG  - 1249-1256
LID - 10.1002/jmri.27141 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) is a newly 
      developed system of bladder cancer staging with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), 
      which can be used to predict the presence of muscle invasion for bladder cancer. 
      PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy of three mpMRI series (T(2) WI, 
      diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], and dynamic contrast-enhanced image [DCEI]) and 
      VI-RADS for diagnosing the muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). STUDY TYPE: 
      Retrospective. POPULATION: In all, 66 pathologically proven bladder cancers in 32 
      patients. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Before the diagnostic MRI with an 
      intramuscular antispasmodic agent, optimal bladder distension was confirmed. 3.0T 
      MRI with T(2) WI, DWI, and DCEI. ASSESSMENT: Three reviewers independently 
      assessed and scored the bladder cancers in T(2) WI, DWI, and DCEI using a 
      five-point score system. Based on the scores in the three sequences, reviewers 
      scored each bladder cancer with reference to VI-RADS categories. We evaluated the 
      diagnostic performance of each of three mpMRI sequences and the final VI-RADS 
      categorization for diagnosing MIBC. STATISTICAL TESTS: Sensitivity, specificity, 
      positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and the area 
      under the curve (AUC) of each of three sequences separately and VI-RADS 
      categorization for diagnosing the MIBC. RESULTS: The diagnostic performances of 
      each of the three mpMRI series and VI-RADS for diagnosing MIBC were excellent. 
      Especially using the optimal cutoff score >3 for predicting MIBC on DWI, DCEI, 
      and VI-RADS, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC values were 90% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 0.56, 1.00), 100% (95% CI: 0.94, 1.00), 100% (95% CI: 
      0.66. 1.00), 98.3% (95% CI: 0.91, 1.00), and 0.95, respectively. DATA CONCLUSION: 
      mpMRI based on VI-RADS can stratify patients with bladder cancer according to the 
      presence of muscle invasion. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3. TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2.

TI  - In vivo evaluation of the levator ani muscle in primiparous women using diffusion 
      tensor imaging and fiber tractography.
PG  - 663-670
LID - 10.1002/ijgo.13897 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the levator ani muscle (LAM) injury after first 
      vaginal delivery and investigate the clinical application of diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography in evaluating the LAM. METHODS: Fifty-eight 
      primiparous women at 6 weeks after vaginal delivery and 27 nulliparous women as 
      controls underwent T2-weighted sequence and DTI sequence of the pelvic floor. A 
      LAM scoring system was used to characterize the morphological changes. Fiber 
      tractography of each major subdivision of LAM was performed, followed by 
      assessment of the quality of fiber tracking. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC), fiber volume, and length were calculated. RESULTS: 
      Puborectalis and iliococcygeus injuries were observed in 30/58 (51.7%) and 10/58 
      (17.2%) primiparae, respectively. No LAM defects were identified in the control 
      group. For the puborectalis, the FA values were lower (P = 0.010) and ADC values 
      were higher (P = 0.024) in the primiparous group than in the control group. For 
      the iliococcygeus, the fiber volume values were lower in the primiparous group 
      than in the control group (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Vaginal delivery can result in 
      LAM injury at the puborectalis. DTI parameters can assist in the quantitative 
      diagnosis of the LAM injury.

TI  - Pubovisceralis Muscle Fiber Architecture Determination: Comparison Between 
      Biomechanical Modeling and Diffusion Tensor Imaging.
PG  - 1255-1265
LID - 10.1007/s10439-016-1788-y [doi]
AB  - Biomechanical analysis of pelvic floor dysfunction requires knowledge of certain 
      biomechanical parameters, such as muscle fiber direction, in order to adequately 
      model function. Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides 
      an estimate of overall muscle fiber directionality based on the mathematical 
      description of water diffusivity. This work aimed at evaluating the concurrence 
      between pubovisceralis muscle fiber representations obtained from DTI, and the 
      maximum principal stress lines obtained through the finite element method. Seven 
      datasets from axial T2-weighted images were used to build numerical models, and 
      muscle fiber orientation estimated from the DT images. The in-plane projections 
      of the first eigenvector of both vector fields describing muscle fiber 
      orientation were extracted and compared. The directional consistency was 
      evaluated by calculating the angle between the normalized vectors for the entire 
      muscle and also for the right and left insertions, middle portions, and anorectal 
      area. The values varied between 28° ± 6 (right middle portion) and 34° ± 9 
      (anorectal area), and were higher than the angular precision of the DT estimates, 
      evaluated using wild bootstrapping analysis. Angular dispersion ranged from 
      17° ± 4 (left middle portion) to 23° ± 5 (anorectal area). Further studies are 
      needed to examine acceptability of these differences when integrating the vectors 
      estimated from DTI in the numerical analysis.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging for the healthy cervical 
      multifidus: a potential method for studying neck muscle physiology following 
      spinal trauma.
PG  - 722-8
LID - 10.2519/jospt.2010.3423 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. OBJECTIVE: To develop a new magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) measure for the diffusive properties of the healthy cervical 
      multifidus and to determine the interrater and intrarater reliability of the 
      measurement. BACKGROUND: Diffusion-weighted MRI, via calculation of the apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC), provides a representation of microscopic movements 
      of water molecules in human tissues and may be useful to assess structural 
      changes in neck muscle, as has been observed following whiplash. The optimal 
      imaging parameters, however, have not been established. METHODS: A 
      diffusion-weighted MRI measure was developed, and, for the basic examination, the 
      right cervical multifidus muscle at the C5 level was studied. A total of 6 
      asymptomatic volunteer individuals (3 females and 3 males) underwent a single 
      diffusion-weighted MRI scan. Interrater and intrarater agreement was evaluated 
      using Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Mean 
      ADCb0-b50 and ADCb50-250 were significantly different from one another (P=.03). 
      The plots confirmed the agreement of raters for ADC of the right cervical 
      multifidus at C5. CONCLUSIONS: A quantitative and reliable diffusion-weighted MRI 
      measure of cervical multifidus ADC has been described. There appears to be a fast 
      and slow component ADC for the healthy multifidus, suggesting changes in 
      extracellular and intracellular volume. Further comparative study is needed to 
      quantify ADCs in the neck muscles in patients with traumatic whiplash.

TI  - (23) Na MRI depicts early changes in ion homeostasis in skeletal muscle tissue of 
      patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 1103-1113
LID - 10.1002/jmri.26681 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a hereditary neuromuscular 
      disease leading to progressive muscle wasting. Since there is a need for MRI 
      variables that serve as early sensitive indicators of response to treatment, 
      several quantitative MRI methods have been suggested for disease monitoring. 
      PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential of sodium ((23) Na) and proton ((1) H) MRI 
      methods to assess early pathological changes in skeletal muscle of DMD. STUDY 
      TYPE: Prospective clinical study. POPULATION: (23) Na and (1) H MRI of the right 
      leg were performed in 13 patients with DMD (age 7.8 ± 2.4) and 14 healthy boys 
      (age 9.5 ± 2.2). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3 T including a multiecho-spin-echo 
      sequence, diffusion-weighted sequences, (1) H spectroscopy, 3-pt Dixon, and (23) 
      Na ultrashort echo time sequences. ASSESSMENT: We obtained water T(2) maps, fat 
      fraction (FF), pH, and diffusion properties of the skeletal muscle tissue. 
      Moreover, total tissue sodium concentration (TSC) was calculated from the (23) Na 
      sequence. Intracellular-weighted (23) Na signal (ICwS) was derived from (23) Na 
      inversion-recovery imaging. STATISTICAL TESTS: Results from DMD patients and 
      controls were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and repeated analysis of 
      variance (ANOVA). Spearman-rank correlations and area under the curve (AUC) were 
      calculated to assess the performance of the different MRI methods to distinguish 
      dystrophic from healthy muscle tissue. RESULTS: FF, water T(2) , and pH were 
      higher in DMD patients (0.07 ± 0.03, 39.4 ± 0.8 msec, 7.06 ± 0.03, all P < 0.05) 
      than in controls (0.02 ± 0.01, 36.0 ± 0.4 msec, 7.03 ± 0.02). No difference was 
      observed in diffusion properties. TSC (26.0 ± 1.3 mM, P < 0.05) and ICwS 
      (0.69 ± 0.05 a.u., P < 0.05) were elevated in DMD (controls: 16.5 ± 1.3 mM and 
      0.47 ± 0.04 a.u.). The ICwS was frequently abnormal in DMD even when water T(2) , 
      FF, and pH were in the normal range. (23) Na MRI showed higher AUC values in 
      comparison to the (1) H methods. DATA CONCLUSION: Sodium anomalies were regularly 
      observed in patients with DMD compared with controls, and were present even in 
      absence of fatty degenerative changes and water T(2) increases. LEVEL OF

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess diagnostic validity and reliability of VI-RADS in predicting 
      muscle invasion by bladder cancer (BCa) and evaluate reviewer acceptance of 
      VI-RADS for clinical routine. METHODS: A prospective multicenter study enrolled 
      331 patients with suspected/untreated BCa who underwent preoperative 
      multiparametric MRI examination (mp-MRI) of the urinary bladder. Four experienced 
      radiologists independently evaluated all mp-MRI using VI-RADS. The diagnostic 
      validity of VI-RADS for predicting muscle invasion by BCa was calculated using 
      histopathology of the first transurethral resection bladder tumor (TURBT) and 
      second TURBT as the reference standards. The kappa statistics (κ) were applied to 
      assess the interreader agreement (IRA). Reviewer acceptance was evaluated with 
      questionnaires. RESULTS: The risk of muscle invasion in VI-RADS 2, 3, 4, and 5 
      after the first and second TURBT was 21.8%, 45.8%, 69.6%, and 96.4% and 24.4%, 
      58.3%, 87%, and 99.2%, respectively. The overall diagnostic validity of VI-RADS 
      was high. The optimal cut-off value for predicting muscle invasion after first 
      TURBT was > VI-RADS 3 (sensitivity = 84.1% and specificity = 92.3%), and after 
      second TURBT was > VI-RADS 2 (sensitivity = 89.9% and specificity = 90.1%). 
      VI-RADS categorization showed a very good IRA (κ = 0.93). Reviewers fully agreed 
      with the statement, "The application of structured reporting of bladder tumor 
      should be encouraged" (score = 20). CONCLUSIONS: VI-RADS showed high diagnostic 
      validity and reliability for predicting muscle invasion by BCa, especially 
      VI-RADS 4 and 5. However, VI-RADS 2 and 3 require further modifications to 
      enhance their diagnostic validity. VI-RADS is highly encouraged to be used in 
      daily practice. KEY POINTS: • VI-RADS showed high diagnostic validity and 
      reliability in predicting BCa muscle invasion, especially VI-RADS 4 and 5. • In 
      VI-RADS 2 and 3, we observed a notable percentage of BCa with muscle invasion and 
      this would require further modifications to enhance the diagnostic validity for 
      these scores. • Overall VI-RADS is well-accepted by radiologists who recommend it 
      for daily practice.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Clinical investigations of neuromuscular diseases routinely 
      involve genetic, neurophysiological, biochemical and histopathological methods. 
      More recently, various magnetic resonance imaging techniques have become 
      available and extended the differential diagnostic possibilities. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Using magnetic resonance imaging it is now possible to quantify muscle 
      volume in selected body regions and measure wasting and exercise-induced muscle 
      hypertrophy. Evidence is forthcoming that many hereditary myopathies are 
      characterized by distinct patterns of muscle degeneration and this helps in 
      selecting other relevant genetic and biochemical investigations. With 
      diffusion-weighted tensor imaging it is possible to identify the microstructure 
      of normal and diseased muscles. Arterial spin labelling is an emerging 
      non-invasive tool to assess blood-flow changes in individual muscles. Magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy now provides an exciting opportunity to visualize 
      metabolic changes and the pathophysiologically relevant cellular perturbations in 
      muscle channelopathies affecting the muscle-specific sodium-channel isoform 
      Na(v)1.4. SUMMARY: Magnetic resonance imaging supplements investigations for the 
      differential diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases. An advantage over routine 
      neurophysiological or histopathological methods is that they are 
      operator-independent, non-invasive and painless. Magnetic resonance imaging also 
      has the advantage of providing a lasting detailed topographical picture of 
      regional variations and allows robust measurements of muscle volume and various 
      functional parameters.

TI  - Heterogeneity of muscle damage induced by electrostimulation: a multimodal MRI 
      study.
PG  - 166-75
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000000397 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Neuromuscular electrostimulation (NMES) leads to a spatially fixed, 
      synchronous, and superficial motor unit recruitment, which could induce muscle 
      damage. Therefore, the extent of muscle damage and its spatial occurrence were 
      expected to be heterogeneous across and along the quadriceps femoris (QF) 
      muscles. The aim of the present study was to characterize muscle spatial 
      heterogeneity in QF damage after a single bout of isometric NMES using multimodal 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Twenty-five young healthy males 
      participated in this study. MRI investigations consisted of the assessment of 
      muscle volume, transverse relaxation time (T2), and diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) in muscles positioned near the stimulation electrodes (i.e., vastus 
      lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM)) and muscles located outside the 
      stimulated regions (i.e., vastus intermedius and rectus femoris). These 
      measurements were performed 6 d before, and 2 d and 4 d (D4) after the NMES 
      session. RESULTS: For the muscles placed in direct contact with the stimulation 
      electrodes, volume (VL, +8.5%; VM, +3.8%), T2 (VL, +19.5%; VM, +6.7%) and radial 
      diffusivity (λ3) (VL, + 7.3%; VM, +3.7%) significantly increased at D4. Whereas 
      MRI parameter changes were larger for VL as compared with those for other QF 
      muscles at D4, homogeneous alterations were found along all QF muscles. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Isometric NMES induced specific and localized alterations in VL and 
      VM, with heterogeneous damage amplitude among them. Potential effects of 
      unaccustomed intermuscle shear stress during electrically evoked isometric 
      contractions could be a key factor in the spatial occurrence and the extent of 
      damage among QF muscles (especially in VL). The kinetics and extent of MRI 
      changes varied between T2 and diffusion tensor imaging metrics, suggesting the 
      involvement of different physiological processes.

TI  - High-energy phosphate transfer in human muscle: diffusion of phosphocreatine.
PG  - C234-41
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00500.2010 [doi]
AB  - The creatine kinase (CK) reaction is central to muscle energetics, buffering ATP 
      levels during periods of intense activity via consumption of phosphocreatine 
      (PCr). PCr is believed to serve as a spatial shuttle of high-energy phosphate 
      between sites of energy production in the mitochondria and sites of energy 
      utilization in the myofibrils via diffusion. Knowledge of the diffusion 
      coefficient of PCr (D(PCr)) is thus critical for modeling and understanding 
      energy transport in the myocyte, but D(PCr) has not been measured in humans. 
      Using localized phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we measured D(PCr) in 
      the calf muscle of 11 adults as a function of direction and diffusion time. The 
      results show that the diffusion of PCr is anisotropic, with significantly higher 
      diffusion along the muscle fibers, and that the diffusion of PCr is restricted to 
      a ∼28-μm pathlength assuming a cylindrical model, with an unbounded diffusion 
      coefficient of ∼0.69 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s. This distance is comparable in size to the 
      myofiber radius. On the basis of prior measures of CK reaction kinetics in human 
      muscle, the expected diffusion distance of PCr during its half-life in the CK 
      reaction is ∼66 μm. This distance is much greater than the average distances 
      between mitochondria and myofibrils. Thus these first measurements of PCr 
      diffusion in human muscle in vivo support the view that PCr diffusion is not a 
      factor limiting high-energy phosphate transport between the mitochondria and the 
      myofibrils in healthy resting myocytes.

TI  - DTI-based muscle fiber tracking of the quadriceps mechanism in lateral patellar 
      dislocation.
PG  - 663-70
LID - 10.1002/jmri.21687 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of using diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) 
      -based muscle fiber tracking to create biomechanical models of the quadriceps 
      mechanism in healthy subjects and those with chronic lateral patellar dislocation 
      (LPD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four healthy (average 14.5 years old; BMI 21.8) and 
      four chronic LPD (average 17.3 years old; BMI 22.4) females underwent DT and 
      axial T1W MRI of the thighs. The anatomical and physiologic cross-sectional areas 
      (ACSA and PCSA, respectively) and pennation angle were calculated of the vastus 
      lateralis oblique (VLO) and vastus medialis oblique (VMO) muscles. The predicted 
      resultant force vector on the patella was calculated. RESULTS: The VLO pennation 
      angles in healthy and LPD subjects were 18.7 and 14.5 degrees, respectively 
      (P=0.141). The VMO pennation angles in healthy and LPD subjects were 11.4 and 
      14.8 degrees, respectively (P=0.02). The ACSA and PCSA VLO:VMO ratios in healthy 
      and LPD subjects were 1.9:1.6 and 2.1:1.6, respectively (P=0.025 and 0.202, 
      respectively). Regardless of whether ACSA or PCSA was used to predict resultant 
      lateral force vectors, the values differed between healthy and LPD subjects 
      (approximately 2 and approximately 5.3 degrees, respectively; P<0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Chronic LPD patients had more laterally directed predicted resultant 
      force vectors than healthy subjects. Our preliminary results suggest that 
      biomechanical models of the quadriceps mechanism in patients with chronic LPD and 
      healthy subjects can be created in healthy subjects and patients with chronic LPD 
      using DT-MRI.

TI  - Reaction-diffusion analysis of the effects of temperature on high-energy 
      phosphate dynamics in goldfish skeletal muscle.
PG  - 975-88
AB  - Thermal acclimation results in dramatic changes in the fractional volume of 
      mitochondria within skeletal muscle of teleost fish. We investigated the 
      hypothesis that changes in mitochondrial volume represent a compensatory response 
      to temperature-induced changes in intracellular diffusion coefficients (D) of the 
      high-energy phosphate compounds ATP and creatine phosphate (PCr). Using 31P 
      nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we determined DPCr and DATP in goldfish 
      (Carassius auratus) skeletal muscle at 25 degrees C and 5 degrees C: DPCr was 
      3.28 +/- 0.18 x 10(-6) cm2s-1 at 25 degrees C and 2.00 +/- 0.90 x 10(-6) cm2s-1 
      at 5 degrees C: DATP was 2.13 +/- 0.16 x 10(-6) cm2s-1 at 25 degrees C and was 
      estimated to be 1.30 x 10(-6) cm2s-1 at 5 degrees C. There was no evidence for an 
      effect of acclimation temperature or fiber type on DATP or DPCr. A mathematical 
      reaction-diffusion model was used to calculate profiles of [ATP], [PCr] and the 
      free energy of ATP hydrolysis (delta GATP) in activated goldfish muscle fibers at 
      5 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The results showed spatial and temporal constancy 
      of [ATP], [PCr] and delta GATP in red fibers at both temperatures, regardless of 
      changes in acclimation temperature or mitochondrial density. The model also 
      showed spatial and temporal constancy of [ATP] in white fibers at 5 degrees C and 
      25 degrees C, but gradients in [PCr] and delta GATP developed in white fibers 
      under all conditions of temperature and acclimation temperature. These gradients 
      were attenuated in cold-acclimated animals by cold-induced increases in 
      mitochondrial density. However, the model shows that the proximal stimulus for 
      temperature-induced changes in mitochondrial volume density in muscle is not a 
      disruption in intracellular diffusion of high-energy phosphates.

TI  - Feasibility study of clinical target volume definition for soft-tissue sarcoma 
      using muscle fiber orientations derived from diffusion tensor imaging.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6560/ac8045 [doi]
AB  - Objective.Soft-tissue sarcoma spreads preferentially along muscle fibers. We 
      explore the utility of deriving muscle fiber orientations from diffusion tensor 
      MRI (DT-MRI) for defining the boundary of the clinical target volume (CTV) in 
      muscle tissue.Approach.We recruited eight healthy volunteers to acquire MR images 
      of the left and right thigh. The imaging session consisted of (a) two MRI 
      spin-echo-based scans, T1- and T2-weighted; (b) a diffusion weighted (DW) 
      spin-echo-based scan using an echo planar acquisition with fat suppression. The 
      thigh muscles were auto-segmented using the convolutional neural network. DT-MRI 
      data were used as a geometry encoding input to solve the anisotropic Eikonal 
      equation with the Hamiltonian Fast-Marching method. The isosurfaces of the 
      solution modeled the CTV boundary.Main results.The auto-segmented muscles of the 
      thigh agreed with manually delineated with the Dice score ranging from 0.8 to 
      0.94 for different muscles. To validate our method of deriving muscle fiber 
      orientations, we compared anisotropy of the isosurfaces across muscles with 
      different anatomical orientations within a thigh, between muscles in the left and 
      right thighs of each subject, and between different subjects. The fiber 
      orientations were identified reproducibly across all comparisons. We identified 
      two controlling parameters, the distance from the gross tumor volume to the 
      isosurface and the eigenvalues ratio, to tailor the proposed CTV to the 
      satisfaction of the clinician.Significance.Our feasibility study with healthy 
      volunteers shows the promise of using muscle fiber orientations derived from DW 
      MRI data for automated generation of anisotropic CTV boundary in soft tissue 
      sarcoma. Our contribution is significant as it serves as a proof of principle for 
      combining DT-MRI information with tumor spread modeling, in contrast to using 
      moderately informative 2D CT planes for the CTV delineation. Such improvements 
      will positively impact the cancer centers with a small volume of sarcoma 
      patients.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Case series. OBJECTIVES: To quantify spinal cord metabolites and 
      neck muscle fast and slow water diffusion in a small sample of patients with 
      chronic whiplash and healthy controls. SETTING: Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. 
      METHODS: In five subjects with chronic whiplash and seven controls, we performed 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the cervical spinal cord and 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the cervical multifidus muscle. RESULTS: 
      Significant reductions in N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratios were found in 
      subjects with chronic whiplash when compared with healthy controls (P = 0.02). 
      Significantly higher fast apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were found in 
      chronic whiplash when compared with the healthy controls (P = 0.01). There was no 
      difference in slow ADCs between the two groups (P = 0.3). CONCLUSION: The 
      potential value of MRS and DWI to quantify the presence of neuromuscular 
      degeneration as a potential mechanism underlying chronic whiplash is recognized. 
      Larger-scaled prospective studies are warranted and required.

TI  - Human calf muscles changes after strength training as revealed by diffusion 
      tensor imaging.
PG  - 853-860
LID - 10.23736/S0022-4707.18.08759-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive MR technique widely 
      employed to study muscle anatomy. DTI parameters have been used to investigate 
      microstructural changes dependent on demographic factors or transient condition 
      such as exercise. The present study is aimed at investigating the diffusion 
      parameters changes of the human calf muscles after a 3-months strength training 
      protocol. METHODS: Ten young men were trained for improving size and strength of 
      the medial (GCM), lateral gastrocnemius (GCL) and soleus (SL) three times a week, 
      with at least 24 hours between training sessions, for a period of three months. 
      Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired at the beginning of 
      the training period (TPRE) and at three months (TPOST) using a 3T scanner. The 
      fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and tensor eigenvalues (λ1, λ2, 
      λ3) were derived from the diffusion weighted imaging data. RESULTS: We found a 
      significant increase in λ1, λ2, λ3 and MD values and muscle volumes between TPRE 
      and TPOST in all the examined muscles both for the left and right side. No 
      significant differences were highlighted for FA. CONCLUSIONS: DTI enables the 
      investigation of muscle microstructure, allowing for the assessment of diffusion 
      parameters variation of the muscle tissue in response to training thus being a 
      useful tool to investigate physiological and pathological changes in skeletal 
      muscle microstructure which could be employed to test the outcomes and the 
      effectiveness of a given training protocol.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging and quantitative T2 mapping to monitor muscle recovery 
      following hamstring injury.
PG  - e4902

AB  - MRI examinations are accurate for diagnosing sports-related acute hamstring 
      injuries. However, sensitive imaging methods for assessing recovery of these 
      injuries are lacking. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and quantitative T2 (qT2) 
      mapping have both shown promise for assessing recovery of muscle micro trauma and 
      exercise effects. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of DTI 
      and qT2 mapping for monitoring the muscle recovery processes after acute 
      hamstring injury. In this prospective study, athletes with an acute hamstring 
      injury underwent a 3-T MRI examination of the injured and contralateral 
      hamstrings including DTI and qT2 measurements at three time points: (1) within 1 
      week after sustaining the injury, (2) 2 weeks after time point 1, and (3) return 
      to play (RTP). A linear mixed model was used for time-effect analysis and paired 
      t-tests for the detection of differences between injured and uninjured muscles. 
      Forty-one athletes (age 27.8 ± 7 years; two females and 39 males) were included. 
      Mean RTP time was 50 (range 12-169) days. A significant time effect was found for 
      mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and the second and third eigenvalues 
      (p ≤ 0.001) in the injured muscles. Fractional anisotropy (p = 0.40), first 
      eigenvalue (p = 0.02), and qT2 (p = 0.61) showed no significant time effect. All 
      DTI indices, except for fractional anisotropy, were significantly elevated 
      compared with control muscles right after the injury (p < 0.001). Values 
      normalized during the recovery period, with no significant differences between 
      control and injured muscles at RTP (p values ranged from 0.08 to 0.51). Mean qT2 
      relaxation times in injured muscles were not significantly elevated compared with 
      control muscles at any time point (p > 0.04). In conclusion, DTI can be used to 
      monitor recovery after an acute hamstring injury. Future work should explore the 
      potential of DTI indices to predict RTP and recovery times in athletes after an 
      acute strain injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess rhabdomyolysis-associated skeletal muscle changes induced by 
      complete ischaemia in rabbits using MRI. METHODS: Acute ischaemia was induced in 
      the right hind limb of 34 New Zealand white rabbits by arterial ligation. MRI of 
      vastus lateralis was carried out pre-operatively and every hour post-operatively 
      up to 7 h. T1 weighted images, T2 weighted images with fat suppression, T2 maps 
      and diffusion tensor scans were obtained. The correlation of MRI findings with 
      histopathological changes in biopsies of vastus lateralis was examined. RESULTS: 
      Histopathology demonstrated early cellular oedema 1 h post ischaemia and 
      irreversible injuries by 7 h, including loss of striation and broken muscle 
      fibres. T2 weighted images with fat suppression showed inhomogeneous high signal 
      intensity of vastus lateralis, which progressively increased from 2 h following 
      ischaemia. The T2 relaxation rate of ischaemic vastus lateralis was significantly 
      greater than normal muscle (p<0.001) and demonstrated a linear increase with time 
      following ischaemia. A similar linear increase was also found in the ischaemic 
      vastus lateralis apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 1-5 h post ischaemia 
      (p=0.006). Both the T2 ADC and fractional anisotropy (FA) were significantly 
      higher on the ischaemic side 7 h post ischaemia (for T2, p=0.02; for ADC, 
      p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Muscle oedema is detectable on MR images and is reflected 
      well by T2, ADC and FA values. MRI may have value in clinical evaluation of 
      rhabdomyolysis. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Ischaemic changes detected by MRI may have 
      value in the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis.

TI  - A Bayesian approach to distinguishing interdigitated tongue muscles from limited 
      diffusion magnetic resonance imaging.

AB  - The tongue is a critical organ for a variety of functions, including swallowing, 
      respiration, and speech. It contains intrinsic and extrinsic muscles that play an 
      important role in changing its shape and position. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      has been used to reconstruct tongue muscle fiber tracts. However, previous 
      studies have been unable to reconstruct the crossing fibers that occur where the 
      tongue muscles interdigitate, which is a large percentage of the tongue volume. 
      To resolve crossing fibers, multi-tensor models on DTI and more advanced imaging 
      modalities, such as high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) and 
      diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), have been proposed. However, because of the 
      involuntary nature of swallowing, there is insufficient time to acquire a 
      sufficient number of diffusion gradient directions to resolve crossing fibers 
      while the in vivo tongue is in a fixed position. In this work, we address the 
      challenge of distinguishing interdigitated tongue muscles from limited diffusion 
      magnetic resonance imaging by using a multi-tensor model with a fixed tensor 
      basis and incorporating prior directional knowledge. The prior directional 
      knowledge provides information on likely fiber directions at each voxel, and is 
      computed with anatomical knowledge of tongue muscles. The fiber directions are 
      estimated within a maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework, and the resulting 
      objective function is solved using a noise-aware weighted ℓ1-norm minimization 
      algorithm. Experiments were performed on a digital crossing phantom and in vivo 
      tongue diffusion data including three control subjects and four patients with 
      glossectomies. On the digital phantom, effects of parameters, noise, and prior 
      direction accuracy were studied, and parameter settings for real data were 
      determined. The results on the in vivo data demonstrate that the proposed method 
      is able to resolve interdigitated tongue muscles with limited gradient 
      directions. The distributions of the computed fiber directions in both the 
      controls and the patients were also compared, suggesting a potential clinical use 
      for this imaging and image analysis methodology.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The effects of nusinersen in adults with SMA rely on neuromotor 
      function scales and qualitative assessments. There are limited clinical or 
      imaging data on muscle changes over time. METHODS: Two adult SMA patients 
      underwent clinical assessments including measures of upper and lower limb 
      function with Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) and Hammersmith Function Motor 
      Scale Expanded (HFMSE); both patients were also studied with whole-body muscle 
      MRI (T1-weighted and Diffusion Tensor Imaging/DTI sequences), at baseline and 
      after 10 and 24 months from the beginning of treatment with nusinersen. RESULTS: 
      After two years of treatment, HFMSE and RULM scores were stable in both patients. 
      DTI sequences revealed an increased number, length and organization of muscle 
      fiber tracks, and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values showed a significant 
      reduction after 10 and 24 months from baseline, in their corresponding maps. 
      DISCUSSION: Muscle DTI imaging seems to play an interesting role to monitor 
      treatment effects over time in adult SMA patients.

TI  - Increased Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Values of Masticatory Muscles on 
      Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients With Temporomandibular 
      Joint Disorder and Unilateral Pain.

AB  - PURPOSE: Myalgia of the masticatory muscles is difficult to evaluate 
      quantitatively. The purpose of the present study was to quantitatively assess 
      myalgia of the masticatory muscles in patients with temporomandibular disorders 
      (TMDs) using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on diffusion-weighted 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who had 
      undergone MRI with clinically diagnosed TMDs according to the criteria of the 
      American Academy of Orofacial Pain and unilateral temporomandibular joint pain 
      from March 2015 to January 2017 were prospectively enrolled. The MRI techniques 
      used included axial diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and short T1 inversion 
      recovery imaging through the neck to the skull base. The regions of interest were 
      drawn to completely include the right and left lateral pterygoid muscles, medial 
      pterygoid muscles, and masseter muscles on a slice demonstrating the largest area 
      of each muscle on the ADC map. We compared each masticatory muscle of the pain 
      side with those of the contralateral side without pain. RESULTS: A total of 106 
      patients with TMD had met the inclusion criteria (18 males, 88 females; mean age, 
      48.7 years; range, 16 to 80). The mean ADC values of the masticatory muscles of 
      the pain side were significantly greater than those of the no-pain sides 
      (P < .01), as were those for the lateral pterygoid muscles 
      (1.35 ± 0.79 × 10(-3) mm(2)/second vs 1.13 ± 0.77 × 10(-3) mm(2)/second), medial 
      pterygoid muscles (1.28 ± 0.46 × 10(-3) mm(2)/second vs 
      1.05 ± 0.69 × 10(-3) mm(2)/second), masseter muscles 
      (1.33 ± 0.78 × 10(-3) mm(2)/second vs 1.09 ± 0.64 × 10(-3) mm(2)/second). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The ADC values of the masticatory muscles on the pain side were 
      significantly greater than those of the contralateral side without pain. Our 
      results suggest that DWI could be used to assess myalgia of the masticatory 
      muscles quantitatively.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the current role of WB-MRI for rheumatic inflammatory 
      diseases in clinical practice using a survey addressed to musculoskeletal 
      radiologists. METHODS: A survey composed of 61 questions, subdivided in three 
      sections, demographics (five questions), application of WB-MRI for inflammatory 
      musculoskeletal diseases in adults and children (28 questions: 7 open and 21 
      multiple choice for each subgroup) was distributed via the European Society of 
      Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) from July 2 to December 31, 2018 to radiologists 
      working in academic, private, and public workplaces. Comparisons among the 
      different workplaces were performed using the Chi-squared and the Kruskal-Wallis 
      test for nominal and ordinal data, respectively (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Seventy-two 
      participants out of the 1779 (4%) members of the ESSR with 10.4 ± 7.9 years of 
      experience in musculoskeletal imaging, replied to at least one question. 30.6% 
      and 12.3% of the respondents performed at least 50 WB-MRI examinations per year 
      in adults and children, respectively. The most frequent indications were myositis 
      in adults and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) in children, the 
      latter mostly in academic centers (p = 0.013). The ESSR Arthrits Subcommitte's 
      protocol was applied by half of the participants and especially radiologists 
      working in private practice used it for adults (p = 0.025). Contrast medium was 
      rarely used for adults particularly by academics (p = 0.04). Diffusion Weighted 
      Imaging was applied for children mostly in private practice (p = 0.01) although, 
      overall, it plays a marginal role. Scoring systems were rarely used. Ongoing 
      research is limited. CONCLUSION: WB-MRI is not routinely applied for 
      musculoskeletal inflammatory diseases. The most frequent indications are myositis 
      and CRMO.

TI  - Effectiveness of diffusion tensor imaging in assessing disease severity in 
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy: preliminary study.
PG  - 582-9
LID - 10.1007/s00247-014-3187-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is currently a lack of suitable objective endpoints to measure 
      disease progression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Emerging research 
      suggests that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has potential as an outcome measure 
      for the evaluation of skeletal muscle injury. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this 
      study was to evaluate the potential of DTI as quantitative magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) markers of disease severity in DMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen 
      consecutive boys (8.9 years ± 3.0 years) with DMD were evaluated using DTI. 
      Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were compared 
      with clinical outcome measures of manual muscle testing and MRI determinations of 
      muscle fat fraction (MFF) in the right lower extremity. RESULTS: Both MRI 
      measures of FA and ADC strongly correlated with age and muscle strength. Values 
      for FA positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with muscle 
      strength (r = 0.78 and -0.96; both P ≤ 0.002) while measures of ADC negatively 
      correlated age, but positively correlated with muscle strength (r = -0.87 and 
      0.83; both P ≤ 0.0004). Additionally, ADC and FA strongly correlated with MFF 
      (r = -0.891 and 0.894, respectively; both P ≤ 0.0001). Mean MMF was negatively 
      correlated with muscle strength (r = -0.89, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: DTI measures 
      of muscle structure strongly correlated with muscle strength and adiposity in 
      boys with DMD in this pilot study, although these markers may be more reflective 
      of fat replacement rather than muscle damage in later stages of the disease. 
      Further studies in presymptomatic younger children are needed to assess the 
      ability of DTI to detect early changes in DMD.

TI  - Multiparametric quantitative MRI assessment of thigh muscles in limb-girdle 
      muscular dystrophy 2A and 2B.
PG  - 550-558
LID - 10.1002/mus.26189 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to apply quantitative MRI (qMRI) to 
      assess structural modifications in thigh muscles of subjects with limb girdle 
      muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2A and 2B with long disease duration. METHODS: Eleven 
      LGMD2A, 9 LGMD2B patients and 11 healthy controls underwent a multi-parametric 3T 
      MRI examination of the thigh. The protocol included structural T1-weighted 
      images, DIXON sequences for fat fraction calculation, T2 values quantification 
      and diffusion MRI. Region of interest analysis was performed on 4 different 
      compartments (anterior compartment, posterior compartment, gracilis, sartorius). 
      RESULTS: Patients showed high levels of fat infiltration as measured by DIXON 
      sequences. Sartorius and anterior compartment were more infiltrated in LGMD2B 
      than LGMD2A patients. T2 values were mildly reduced in both disorders. 
      Correlations between clinical scores and qMRI were found. CONCLUSIONS: qMRI 
      measures may help to quantify muscular degeneration, but careful interpretation 
      is needed when fat infiltration is massive. Muscle Nerve 58: 550-558, 2018.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging indices of acute muscle damage are augmented after 
      exercise in peripheral arterial disease.
PG  - 2595-2606
LID - 10.1007/s00421-021-04711-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Although it is known that peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is 
      associated with chronic myopathies, the acute muscular responses to exercise in 
      this population are less clear. This study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to 
      compare acute exercise-related muscle damage between PAD patients and healthy 
      controls. METHODS: Eight PAD patients and seven healthy controls performed graded 
      plantar flexion in the bore of a 3T MRI scanner. Exercise began at 2 kg and 
      increased by 2 kg every 2 min until failure, or completion of 10 min of exercise. 
      DTI images were acquired from the lower leg pre- and post-exercise, and were 
      analyzed for mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy (FA), and eigenvalues 1-3 
      (λ(1-3)) of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA). RESULTS: 
      Results indicated a significant leg by time interaction for mean diffusivity, 
      explained by a significantly greater increase in diffusivity of the MG in the 
      most affected legs of PAD patients (11.1 × 10(-4) ± 0.5 × 10(-4) mm(2)/s vs. 
      12.7 × 10(-4) ± 1.2 × 10(-4) mm(2)/s at pre and post, respectively, P = 0.02) 
      compared to healthy control subjects (10.8 × 10(-4) ± 0.3 × 10(-4) mm(2)/s vs. 
      11.2 × 10(-4) ± 0.5 × 10(-4) mm(2)/s at pre and post, respectively, P = 1.0). No 
      significant differences were observed for the TA, or λ(1-3) (all P ≥ 0.06). 
      Moreover, no reciprocal changes were observed for FA in either group (all 
      P ≥ 0.29). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that calf muscle diffusivity increases 
      more in PAD patients compared to controls after exercise. These findings are 
      consistent with the notion that acute exercise results in increased muscle damage 
      in PAD.

TI  - Effects of image noise in muscle diffusion tensor (DT)-MRI assessed using 
      numerical simulations.

LID - 10.1002/mrm.21707 [doi]
AB  - Diffusion tensor (DT)-MRI studies of skeletal muscle provide information about 
      muscle architecture, microstructure, and damage. However, the effects of noise, 
      the diffusion weighting (b)-value, and partial volume artifacts on the estimation 
      of the diffusion tensor (D) are unknown. This study investigated these issues 
      using Monte Carlo simulations of 3 x 9 voxel regions of interest (ROIs) 
      containing muscle, adipose tissue, and intermediate degrees of muscle volume 
      fractions (f(M)). A total of 1000 simulations were performed for each of eight 
      b-values and 11 SNR levels. The dependencies of the eigenvalues (lambda(1-3)), 
      mean diffusivity (lambda), and fractional anisotropy (FA), and the angular 
      deviation of the first eigenvector from its true value (alpha) were observed. For 
      moderate b-values (b = 435-725 s/mm(2)) and f(M) = 1, an accuracy of 5% was 
      obtained for lambda(1-3), lambda, and FA with an SNR of 25. An accuracy of 1% was 
      obtained for lambda(1-3), lambda, and FA with f(M) = 1 and SNR = 50. For regions 
      with f(M) = 8/9, 5% accuracy was obtained with SNR = 40. For alpha, SNRs of 
      >or=25 and >or=45 were required for +/-4.5 degrees uncertainty with f(M) = 1 and 
      f(M) = 0.5, respectively; SNR >or= 60 was required for +/-9 degrees uncertainty 
      in single muscle voxels. These findings may influence the design and 
      interpretation of DT-MRI studies of muscle microstructure, damage, and 
      architecture.

TI  - Differential diagnosis of uterine smooth muscle tumors using diffusion-weighted 
      imaging: correlations with the apparent diffusion coefficient and cell density.
PG  - 1742-52

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the utility of the apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) in differentiating benign and malignant uterine smooth muscle 
      tumors classified by signal intensity (SI) on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and to determine the correlation between ADC 
      and tumor cell density. This retrospective study reviewed 168 lesions in 134 
      cases with pathologically confirmed uterine smooth muscle tumors, including 6 
      leiomyosarcomas and 3 smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential, and 
      preoperative magnetic resonance imaging examinations performed between October 
      2009 and November 2012. T2WI and DWI were also performed for each subject. Tumors 
      were then classified according to SI on T2WI and DWI relative to myometrial SI. 
      The correlation between ADC and tumor cell density was also determined. In Group 
      1 (high on both T2WI/DWI), mean ADC was significantly lower for leiomyosarcoma 
      (0.91 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) than for leiomyoma (1.30 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; p < 0.05) and 
      mean cell density significantly higher for leiomyosarcoma (42.9%) than for 
      leiomyoma (22.4%; p < 0.05). A strong negative correlation was seen between ADC 
      and tumor cell density in Group 1 (Spearman, R = -0.72; p < 0.05). ADC may help 
      to differentiate benign from malignant uterine smooth muscle tumors, particularly 
      tumors with high SI on T2WI and DWI.

AB  - For detailed analyses of muscle adaptation mechanisms during growth, ageing or 
      disease, reliable measurements of muscle architecture are required. Diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) and DTI tractography have been used to reconstruct the 
      architecture of human muscles in vivo. However, muscle architecture measurements 
      reconstructed with conventional DTI techniques are often anatomically implausible 
      because the reconstructed fascicles do not terminate on aponeuroses, as real 
      muscle fascicles are known to do. In this study, we tested the reliability of an 
      anatomically constrained DTI-based method for measuring three-dimensional muscle 
      architecture. Anatomical magnetic resonance images and diffusion tensor images 
      were obtained from the left legs of eight healthy participants on two occasions 
      one week apart. Muscle volumes, fascicle lengths, pennation angles and fascicle 
      curvatures were measured in the medial and lateral gastrocnemius, soleus and the 
      tibialis anterior muscles. Averaged across muscles, the intraclass correlation 
      coefficient was 0.99 for muscle volume, 0.81 for fascicle length, 0.73 for 
      pennation angle and 0.76 for fascicle curvature. Measurements of muscle 
      architecture obtained using conventional DTI tractography were highly sensitive 
      to variations in the stopping criteria for DTI tractography. The application of 
      anatomical constraints reduced this sensitivity significantly. This study 
      demonstrates that anatomically constrained DTI tractography can provide reliable 
      and robust three-dimensional measurements of whole-muscle architecture. The 
      algorithms used to constrain tractography have been made publicly available.

      elongation and shortening.
PG  - 767-75
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3529 [doi]
AB  - Diffusional kurtosis MRI (DKI) quantifies the deviation of water diffusion from a 
      Gaussian distribution. We investigated the influence of passive elongation and 
      shortening of the lower leg muscles on the DKI parameters D (diffusion 
      coefficient) and K (kurtosis). After approval by the local ethics committee, 
      eight healthy volunteers (age, 29.1 ± 2.9 years) underwent MRI of the lower leg 
      at 3 T. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired with 10 different b values at 
      three ankle positions (passive dorsiflexion 10°, neutral position 0°, passive 
      plantar flexion 40°). Parametrical maps of D and K were obtained by voxel-wise 
      fitting of the signal intensities using a non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt 
      algorithm. D and K were measured in the tibialis anterior, medial and lateral 
      gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles. In the neutral position, D and K values were 
      in the range between 1.66-1.79 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s and 0.21-0.39, respectively. D 
      and K increased with passive shortening, and decreased with passive elongation, 
      which could also be illustrated on the parametrical maps. In dorsiflexion, D 
      (p < 0.01) and K (p = 0.036) were higher in the tibialis anterior than in the 
      medial gastrocnemius. In plantar flexion, the opposite was found for K 
      (p = 0.035). DKI parameters in the lower leg muscles are significantly influenced 
      by the ankle joint position, indicating that the diffusion of water molecules in 
      skeletal muscle deviates from a Gaussian distribution depending on muscle tonus.

TI  - Grading of rabbit skeletal muscle trauma by diffusion tensor imaging and 
      tractography on magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 276-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To distinguish the edema, injury, or rupture in the traumatic skeletal 
      muscle fiber in vivo using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography on 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: The skeletal muscle trauma models were 
      made in 4 rabbits (eight hindlimbs) by iron discus (weight 1.0 kg, diameter 6 cm) 
      falling down vertically from 45 cm height to rabbits' thighs. Conventional 
      sequences and two-dimensional (2D) diffusion-weighted (DW) spin-echo (SE) echo 
      planar imaging (EPI) sequence with fat suppression (b = 600 s/mm2) were performed 
      on 1. 5T MRI scanner. The grading of edema, injury, and fiber rupture in the 
      damaged muscle were made according to their histopathological views, which was 
      consistent with the images. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values 
      and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured from the region of interests 
      (ROIs) of all groups on 2D DW images used for tractography. Analysis of variance 
      test was performed to analyze all data. RESULTS: ADC values of the areas in 
      normal muscle, edema muscle, injury muscle, and ruptured muscle were (6.12 +/- 
      1.34) x 10(-3), (6.38 +/- 1.30) x 10(-3), (8.06 +/- 0.97) x 10(-3), and (9.57 +/- 
      0.93) x 10(-3) mm2/s, respectively. There was significant difference among groups 
      (P < 0.001), but no difference between edema muscle and normal muscle group (P > 
      0.05). The FA values of normal muscle, edema muscle, injury muscle, and ruptured 
      muscle were 0.42 +/- 0.12, 0.36 +/- 0.12, 0.26 +/- 0.09, 0.12 +/- 0.08, 
      respectively, with a significant difference among groups (P < 0.001). In the 
      edema muscle, the tracking cross-fiber could be seen but it decreased slightly. 
      In the injury muscle, the tracking fiber decreased markedly. In the ruptured 
      muscle, the transverse-orientation tracking fiber vanished, yet some interrupted 
      longitudinal-orientation tracking fiber could be found. CONCLUSION: The edema, 
      injury, and rupture of muscle fiber in rabbit damaged skeletal muscle can be 
      verified according to the ADC and the FA on DTI and tractography.

      patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between bladder multiparametric 
      magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) findings after pembrolizumab and the 
      pathological complete response (CR; pT0). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Patients were staged using bladder mpMRI whereby radiologists were asked to 
      characterize the following parameters: residual disease at T1- and T2-weighted 
      images (step 1: yes/no), presence of hyperintense spots within the bladder wall 
      on diffusion-weighted imaging (step 2: yes/no), and presence of pathological 
      contrast enhancement (step 3: yes/no), before and after three cycles of 
      pembrolizumab. Examinations were internally assessed by two senior radiologists 
      and externally evaluated by a third senior radiologist. INTERVENTION: To evaluate 
      bladder tumor response after neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, mpMRI was used. OUTCOME 
      MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary objective was to predict the 
      pT0 after neoadjuvant pembrolizumab by relying on the mpMRI findings. Cohen's 
      kappa statistics was used to assess interobserver variability. Univariable 
      analyses for pT0 were performed including internal and external post-therapy 
      mpMRI steps. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: From February 2017 to October 2018, 82 
      patients (164 total mpMRI assessments) were analyzed. The agreement between the 
      internal and external mpMRI assessments after therapy was acceptable (κ values 
      ranging from 0.5 to 0.76). Each mpMRI step was significantly associated with pT0 
      in both internal and external assessments. In patients with CR/no evidence of 
      residual disease (NED) in all internally evaluated mpMRI steps (N = 37), the pT0 
      was seen in 23 (62%), compared with 19 of 26 externally evaluated NED patients 
      (73%). CONCLUSIONS: In post-pembrolizumab muscle-invasive bladder cancer, mpMRI 
      sequence assessment had acceptable interobserver variability and represented the 
      basis for the proposal of a radiological CR/NED status definition predicting the 
      pT0 response to pembrolizumab. After validation of these findings with external 
      datasets, we propose this tool for developing bladder-sparing immunotherapy 
      maintenance therapies. PATIENT SUMMARY: Assessment of the extent of disease in 
      patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer using conventional imaging yields 
      serious limitations. In the PURE-01 study, we evaluated the potential of bladder 
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict the pathological 
      complete response to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab. After validation with larger 
      datasets, the proposed stepwise assessment incorporating multiparametric MRI 
      sequences will be used at our center to develop bladder-sparing approaches in 
      future studies.

TI  - Quantitation of bladder cancer for the prediction of muscle layer invasion as a 
      complement to the vesical imaging-reporting and data system.
PG  - 1656-1666
LID - 10.1007/s00330-020-07224-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the diagnostic performance of Vesical Imaging-Reporting 
      and Data System (VIRADS) and to find a quantitative indicator for predicting 
      muscle layer invasion of bladder cancer. METHODS: 3-T MRI of 82 patients 
      performed before transurethral resection of bladder tumors or radical cystectomy 
      between July 2018 and June 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. For one index 
      lesion of each patient, two radiologists independently assigned VIRADS score and 
      measured tumor-wall interface (contact length between tumor and bladder wall) on 
      T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Inter-reader 
      agreement was assessed, and logistic regression analysis was performed to find 
      indicators of muscle layer invasion. Comparison of indicators' diagnostic 
      performance was done with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and 
      generalized linear model analyses. Optimal cutoff point was determined by the 
      Youden index J. RESULTS: Inter-reader agreement was at least substantial for 
      VIRADS categorization (κ 0.77-0.81), and almost perfect for tumor-wall interface 
      (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.88-0.90). Tumor-wall interface (odds ratio 
      [OR] 1.90-2.00) and VIRADS score (OR 8.59-8.89) were independently associated 
      with muscle layer invasion (p ≤ 0.02). For VIRADS, area under the ROC curve 
      (AUROC) was 0.94, and the accuracy was 0.93 at score 3, the optimal threshold for 
      predicting muscle layer invasion. Depending on the MRI sequence, tumor-wall 
      interface showed AUROCs of 0.90-0.92 and accuracy of 0.84-0.90 at suggested 
      thresholds (3 ± 0.3 cm). Tumor-wall interface showed insignificant differences in 
      accuracy compared with VIRADS (p > 0.10), except as measured on 
      diffusion-weighted images (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: VIRADS is a good predictor of 
      muscle layer invasion. As an independent quantitative indicator, tumor-wall 
      interface may complement VIRADS to enhance prediction. KEY POINTS: • Vesical 
      Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VIRADS) is a promising predictor of muscle 
      invasion of bladder cancer with good reproducibility, as suggested by previous 
      studies. • VIRADS score and the tumor-wall interface (curvilinear contact length 
      between the tumor and the bladder wall) are independent predictors of muscle 
      layer invasion. • As an easy-to-use quantitative indicator, tumor-wall interface 
      is expected to be used as an indicator complementary to VIRADS, a qualitative 
      indicator.

TI  - Intramuscular water movement during and after isometric muscle contraction: 
      evaluation at different exercise intensities.
PG  - 368-75
LID - 10.1111/cpf.12239 [doi]
AB  - We aimed at evaluating the effect of isometric muscle contraction on 
      intramuscular water movement at different exercise intensities. Seven men 
      performed 1-min isometric ankle dorsiflexion (20% and 50% maximal voluntary 
      contractions [MVCs]) with a non-magnetic custom-made dynamometer, inside a 
      magnetic resonance (MR) device. Axial diffusion-weighted images were obtained 
      before, during and at 1-20 min (1-min interval) after the exercise to calculate 
      the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the tibialis anterior. Under the same 
      exercise condition, the concentration change of total haemoglobin (Hb) and 
      myoglobin (Mb) (total Hb/Mb) within the tibialis anterior was assessed by 
      performing near-infrared spectroscopy before, during and after the exercise 
      outside the MR device. The 20% MVC exercise significantly increased the ADC only 
      at 1 min postexercise (P<0·01), whereas the ADC significantly increased during 
      and at 2-20 min after the 50% MVC exercise (P<0·01). The 20% MVC exercise 
      decreased the total Hb/Mb during exercise (P<0·01), but the value significantly 
      increased at 1 min postexercise (P<0·01). The total Hb/Mb significantly decreased 
      during the 50% MVC exercise, but significantly increased at 1-5 min postexercise 
      (P<0·01). One-minute moderate-intensity isometric exercise activates 
      intramuscular water movement during and after the exercise. This activation was 
      found even after a low-intensity exercise, but the effect was small and did not 
      last long. The effect of intramuscular hyperaemia on the postexercise ADC 
      elevation may be limited to the very early period after low- to 
      moderate-intensity exercises.

TI  - Multi-parametric MRI characterization of healthy human thigh muscles at 3.0 T - 
      relaxation, magnetization transfer, fat/water, and diffusion tensor imaging.
PG  - 1070-84
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3159 [doi]
AB  - Muscle diseases commonly have clinical presentations of inflammation, fat 
      infiltration, fibrosis, and atrophy. However, the results of existing laboratory 
      tests and clinical presentations are not well correlated. Advanced quantitative 
      MRI techniques may allow the assessment of myo-pathological changes in a 
      sensitive and objective manner. To progress towards this goal, an array of 
      quantitative MRI protocols was implemented for human thigh muscles; their 
      reproducibility was assessed; and the statistical relationships among parameters 
      were determined. These quantitative methods included fat/water imaging, multiple 
      spin-echo T2 imaging (with and without fat signal suppression, FS), selective 
      inversion recovery for T1 and quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging 
      (with and without FS), and diffusion tensor imaging. Data were acquired at 3.0 T 
      from nine healthy subjects. To assess the repeatability of each method, the 
      subjects were re-imaged an average of 35 days later. Pre-testing lifestyle 
      restrictions were applied to standardize physiological conditions across scans. 
      Strong between-day intra-class correlations were observed in all quantitative 
      indices except for the macromolecular-to-free water pool size ratio (PSR) with 
      FS, a metric derived from qMT data. Two-way analysis of variance revealed no 
      significant between-day differences in the mean values for any parameter 
      estimate. The repeatability was further assessed with Bland-Altman plots, and low 
      repeatability coefficients were obtained for all parameters. Among-muscle 
      differences in the quantitative MRI indices and inter-class correlations among 
      the parameters were identified. There were inverse relationships between 
      fractional anisotropy (FA) and the second eigenvalue, the third eigenvalue, and 
      the standard deviation of the first eigenvector. The FA was positively related to 
      the PSR, while the other diffusion indices were inversely related to the PSR. 
      These findings support the use of these T1 , T2 , fat/water, and DTI protocols 
      for characterizing skeletal muscle using MRI. Moreover, the data support the 
      existence of a common biophysical mechanism, water content, as a source of 
      variation in these parameters.

TI  - Turbo Gradient and Spin-Echo BLADE-DWI for Extraocular Muscles in 
      Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12010344 [doi]
LID - 344
AB  - Purpose: To investigate feasibility and diagnostic performance of turbo gradient 
      and spin-echo BLADE (proprietary name for Periodically Rotated Overlapping 
      ParallEL Lines with Enhanced Reconstruction [PROPELLER] in Siemens MR 
      systems)-diffusion weighted imaging (TGSE-BLADE-DWI) for depicting extraocular 
      muscle (EOM) involvement and activity in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), 
      and to compare TGSE-BLADE-DWI with readout-segmented echo-planar imaging 
      (RESOLVE). Materials and methods: Thirty-five patients with identified TAO 
      underwent the two DWI scans. Two radiologists visually scored the image quality 
      of the two DWIs with respect to the susceptibility artifacts and geometric 
      distortions on a three-point scale. The maximum size (Size(max)) of EOMs and 
      corresponding ADCs (cADCs) of each patient were compared between the active and 
      inactive phases. The clinical activity score (CAS) was used as a reference to 
      assess the diagnostic performance of EOM ADCs for grading TAO activity. ROC 
      analysis, Pearson correlation, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used for 
      statistical analyses. Results: For scores of EOMs, the image quality of 
      TGSE-BLADE-DWI was significantly higher than that of RESOLVE. There were no 
      statistically significant differences between the AUCs of the two DWIs, 
      Size(max), or cADCs between the active and inactive phases. TGSE-BLADE-DWI ADCs 
      were significantly higher than the RESOLVE ADCs in the right superior rectus, 
      right lateral rectus, left superior rectus, and left inferior rectus. There were 
      no statistically significant correlations between the cADC or Size(max), and CAS. 
      The highest AUC was 0.697 for RESOLVE and 0.657 for TGSE-BLADE-DWI. The best 
      performing ADC threshold was 1.85 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s with 85.7% sensitivity, 58.8% 
      specificity and 66.67% accuracy for RESOLVE and 1.99 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s with 79.0% 
      sensitivity, and 55.6% specificity and 65.27% accuracy for TGSE-BLADE-DWI. 
      Conclusion: Compared to RESOLVE, TGSE-BLADE-DWI provided improved image quality 
      with fewer susceptibility artifacts and geometric distortions for EOM 
      visualization and showed an equivalent performance in detecting active TAO.

TI  - Elaboration of a multisequence MRI-based radiomics signature for the preoperative 
      prediction of the muscle-invasive status of bladder cancer: a double-center 
      study.
PG  - 4816-4827
LID - 10.1007/s00330-020-06796-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a multisequence MRI-based radiomics signature for the 
      preoperative prediction of the muscle-invasive status of bladder cancer (BCa). 
      METHODS: This retrospective study involved 106 eligible patients from two 
      independent clinical centers. All patients underwent a preoperative 3.0 T MRI 
      scan with T2-weighted image (T2WI) and multi-b-value diffusion-weighted image 
      (DWI) sequences. In total, 1404 radiomics features were extracted from the 
      largest region of the reported tumor locations on the T2WI, DWI, and 
      corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC) of each patient. A 
      radiomics signature, namely the Radscore, was then generated using the recursive 
      feature elimination approach and a logistic regression algorithm in a training 
      cohort (n = 64). Its performance was then validated in an independent validation 
      cohort (n = 42). The primary imaging and clinical factors in conjunction with the 
      Radscore were used to determine whether the performance could be further 
      improved. RESULTS: The Radscore, generated by 36 selected radiomics features, 
      demonstrated a favorable ability to predict muscle-invasive BCa status in both 
      the training (AUC 0.880) and validation (AUC 0.813) cohorts. Subsequently, 
      integrating the two independent predictors (including the Radscore and 
      MRI-determined tumor stalk) into a nomogram exhibited more favorable 
      discriminatory performance, with the AUC improved to 0.924 and 0.877 in both 
      cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed multisequence MRI-based 
      radiomics signature alone could be an effective tool for quantitative prediction 
      of muscle-invasive status of BCa. Integrating the Radscore with MRI-determined 
      tumor stalk could further improve the discriminatory power, realizing more 
      accurate prediction of nonmuscle-invasive and muscle-invasive BCa. KEY POINTS: • 
      DWI is superior to T2WI sequence in reflecting the heterogeneous differences 
      between NMIBC and MIBC, and multisequence MRI helps in the preoperative 
      prediction of muscle-invasive status of BCa. • Co-occurrence (CM), run-length 
      matrix (RLM), and gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM) features were the favorable 
      feature categories for the prediction of muscle-invasive status of BCa. • The 
      Radscore (proposed multisequence MRI-based radiomics signature) helps predict 
      preoperatively muscle invasion. Combination with the MRI-determined tumor stalk 
      further improves prediction.

TI  - Polynomial fitting of DT-MRI fiber tracts allows accurate estimation of muscle 
      architectural parameters.
PG  - 589-600
LID - 10.1016/j.mri.2012.02.003 [doi]
AB  - Fiber curvature is a functionally significant muscle structural property, but its 
      estimation from diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging fiber tracking data 
      may be confounded by noise. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use 
      of polynomial fitting of fiber tracts for improving the accuracy and precision of 
      fiber curvature (κ) measurements. Simulated image data sets were created in order 
      to provide data with known values for κ and pennation angle (θ). Simulations were 
      designed to test the effects of increasing inherent fiber curvature (3.8, 7.9, 
      11.8 and 15.3 m(-1)), signal-to-noise ratio (50, 75, 100 and 150) and voxel 
      geometry (13.8- and 27.0-mm(3) voxel volume with isotropic resolution; 13.5-mm(3) 
      volume with an aspect ratio of 4.0) on κ and θ measurements. In the originally 
      reconstructed tracts, θ was estimated accurately under most curvature and all 
      imaging conditions studied; however, the estimates of κ were imprecise and 
      inaccurate. Fitting the tracts to second-order polynomial functions provided 
      accurate and precise estimates of κ for all conditions except very high curvature 
      (κ=15.3 m(-1)), while preserving the accuracy of the θ estimates. Similarly, 
      polynomial fitting of in vivo fiber tracking data reduced the κ values of fitted 
      tracts from those of unfitted tracts and did not change the θ values. Polynomial 
      fitting of fiber tracts allows accurate estimation of physiologically reasonable 
      values of κ, while preserving the accuracy of θ estimation.

TI  - Dynamic diffusion-tensor measurements in muscle tissue using the single-line 
      multiple-echo diffusion-tensor acquisition technique at 3T.
PG  - 667-78
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3296 [doi]
AB  - When diffusion biomarkers display transient changes, i.e. in muscle following 
      exercise, traditional diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) methods lack the temporal 
      resolution to resolve the dynamics. This article presents an MRI method for 
      dynamic diffusion-tensor acquisitions on a clinical 3T scanner. This method, the 
      Single-Line Multiple-Echo Diffusion-Tensor Acquisition Technique (SL-MEDITATE), 
      achieves a high temporal resolution (4 s) by rapid diffusion encoding through the 
      acquisition of multiple echoes with unique diffusion sensitization and limiting 
      the readout to a single line volume. The method is demonstrated in a rotating 
      anisotropic phantom, a flow phantom with adjustable flow speed and in vivo 
      skeletal calf muscle of healthy volunteers following a plantar flexion exercise. 
      The rotating and flow-varying phantom experiments show that SL-MEDITATE correctly 
      identifies the rotation of the first diffusion eigenvector and the changes in 
      diffusion-tensor parameter magnitudes, respectively. Immediately following 
      exercise, the in vivo mean diffusivity (MD) time courses show, before the 
      well-known increase, an initial decrease that is not typically observed in 
      traditional DTI. In conclusion, SL-MEDITATE can be used to capture transient 
      changes in tissue anisotropy in a single line. Future progress might allow for 
      dynamic DTI when combined with appropriate k-space trajectories and compressed 
      sensing reconstruction.

TI  - Assessment of calf muscle contraction by diffusion tensor imaging.
PG  - 2303-10
LID - 10.1007/s00330-008-1012-z [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study was to assess the changes of water diffusion during 
      contraction and elongation of calf muscles using diffusion tensor (DT) MRI in 
      normal volunteers. Twenty volunteers (mean age, 29+/-4 years) underwent DT MRI 
      examination of the right calf. Echo planar imaging sequence was performed at 
      rest, during dorsal flexion and during plantar flexion. The three eigenvalues 
      (lambda1, lambda2, and lambda3), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and 
      fractional anisotropy (FA) of the diffusion tensor were calculated for medial 
      gastrocnemius (mGM) and tibialis anterior (TA). A fiber tractography was 
      performed on both muscles. Non-parametric Wilcoxon and Mann Whitney tests were 
      used for statistical evaluation. At rest, lambda1, lambda2 and ADC of mGM were 
      higher than their counterparts of TA (P<0.01). During dorsal flexion, the three 
      eigenvalues and ADC of TA significantly increased (P<0.05) as their counterparts 
      of mGM slightly decreased (P=NS). Opposite variations were detected during 
      plantar flexion of the foot. Visual analysis evidenced a relationship between 3D 
      representations of MRI fibers and physiological state of muscles. Contraction of 
      calf muscles produces changes in DT parameters, which are related to the 
      physiological state of the muscle.

TI  - Fast low-angle shot diffusion tensor imaging with stimulated echo encoding in the 
      muscle of rabbit shank.
PG  - 146-57
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3046 [doi]
AB  - In the past, spin-echo (SE) echo planar imaging(EPI)-based diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) has been widely used to study the fiber structure of skeletal 
      muscles in vivo. However, this sequence has several shortcomings when measuring 
      restricted diffusion in small animals, such as its sensitivity to 
      susceptibility-related distortions and a relatively short applicable diffusion 
      time. To address these limitations, in the current work, a stimulated echo 
      acquisition mode (STEAM) MRI technique, in combination with fast low-angle shot 
      (FLASH) readout (turbo-STEAM MRI), was implemented and adjusted for DTI in 
      skeletal muscles. Signal preparation using stimulated echoes enables longer 
      effective diffusion times, and thus the detection of restricted diffusion within 
      muscular tissue with intracellular distances up to 100 µm. Furthermore, it has a 
      reduced penalty for fast T2 muscle signal decay, but at the expense of 50% signal 
      loss compared with a SE preparation. Turbo-STEAM MRI facilitates high-resolution 
      DTI of skeletal muscle without introducing susceptibility-related distortions. To 
      demonstrate its applicability, we carried out rabbit in vivo measurements on a 
      human whole-body 3 T scanner. DTI parameters of the shank muscles were extracted, 
      including the apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, eigenvalues 
      and eigenvectors. Eigenvectors were used to calculate maps of structural 
      parameters, such as the planar index and the polar coordinates θ and ϕ of the 
      largest eigenvector. These parameters were compared between three muscles. θ and 
      ϕ showed clear differences between the three muscles, reflecting different 
      pennation angles of the underlying fiber structures. Fiber tractography was 
      performed to visualize and analyze the architecture of skeletal pennate muscles. 
      Optimization of tracking parameters and utilization of T2 -weighted images for 
      improved muscle boundary detection enabled the determination of additional 
      parameters, such as the mean fiber length. The presented results support the 
      applicability of turbo-STEAM MRI as a promising method for quantitative DTI 
      analysis and fiber tractography in skeletal muscles.

TI  - Graves' ophthalmopathy: the role of diffusion-weighted imaging in detecting

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate involvement of the extraocular muscle (EOM) using 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), to determine whether there is correlation with 
      conventional orbital MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in 
      patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO). METHODS: 35 patients known clinically 
      with GO and 21 healthy controls were studied. Patients were assessed with 
      clinical activity scores. All subjects underwent conventional MRI and DWI study. 
      Involvement of the EOM was evaluated. The patients were classified as involved or 
      uninvolved on orbital MRI and their ADC values in DWI compared. RESULTS: There 
      was significant difference in the mean ADC value of all the EOMs in patients vs 
      controls. The ADC values of all the EOMs were higher in patients. There were 
      significant differences in ADC values between uninvolved muscles on conventional 
      MRI and controls for the MR, SR and LR. There was no significant difference in 
      ADC value between the two groups when considering the IR. ADC values of medial, 
      lateral and superior rectus muscles were increased. CONCLUSION: Increased ADC 
      values of the EOM in patients with GO suggest that EOM damage begins at a very 
      early stage before being detected on routine orbital MRI. The routine MRI with 
      DWI sequence will be a useful adjunct in the selection of a group of patients 
      most likely to benefit from early treatment. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study 
      can help to evaluate the involvement of GO in early period with MRI added DWI.

TI  - Reduced cerebral gray matter and altered white matter in boys with Duchenne 
      muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 403-11
LID - 10.1002/ana.24222 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive 
      muscle weakness caused by DMD gene mutations leading to absence of the 
      full-length dystrophin protein in muscle. Multiple dystrophin isoforms are 
      expressed in brain, but little is known about their function. DMD is associated 
      with specific learning and behavioral disabilities that are more prominent in 
      patients with mutations in the distal part of the DMD gene, predicted to affect 
      expression of shorter protein isoforms. We used quantitative magnetic resonance 
      (MR) imaging to study brain microstructure in DMD. METHODS: T1-weighted and 
      diffusion tensor images were obtained on a 3T MR scanner from 30 patients and 22 
      age-matched controls (age = 8-18 years). All subjects underwent 
      neuropsychological examination. Group comparisons on tissue volume and diffusion 
      tensor imaging parameters were made between DMD patients and controls, and 
      between 2 DMD subgroups that were classified according to predicted Dp140 isoform 
      expression (DMD_Dp140(+) and DMD_Dp140(-) ). RESULTS: DMD patients had smaller 
      total brain volume, smaller gray matter volume, lower white matter fractional 
      anisotropy, and higher white matter mean and radial diffusivity than healthy 
      controls. DMD patients also performed worse on neuropsychological examination. 
      Subgroup analyses showed that DMD_Dp140(-) subjects contributed most to the gray 
      matter volume differences and performed worse on information processing. 
      INTERPRETATION: Both gray and white matter is affected in boys with DMD at a 
      whole brain level. Differences between the DMD_Dp140(-) subgroup and controls 
      indicate an important role for the Dp140 dystrophin isoform in cerebral 
      development.

TI  - Noninvasive Evaluation of Trunk Muscle Recruitment after Trunk Exercises using 
      Diffusion-weighted MR Imaging.
PG  - 173-81
LID - 10.2463/mrms.2014-0073 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated trunk muscle recruitment in abdominal and back exercises 
      with magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted imaging. METHODS: Twelve men 
      performed bent-knee sit-up, crunch, trunk lateral flexion, and trunk extension 
      exercises. We obtained axial diffusion-weighted images of the trunk before and 
      after each exercise using a 1.5-tesla MR system, calculated apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) values from the right and left rectus abdominis, lateral 
      abdominal, psoas major, quadratus lumborum, and intrinsic back muscles to 
      evaluate the activity of these muscles during each exercise, and compared ADC 
      values before and after exercise using a paired t-test. RESULTS: The ADCs of the 
      rectus abdominis (right, +19.1%; left, +11.7%), lateral abdominal (right, +15.5%; 
      left, +14.1%), and psoas major (right, +14.8%; left, +15.9%) muscles on both 
      sides increased after the bent-knee sit-up (P < 0.01). The ADCs of the rectus 
      abdominis (right, +16.8%; left, +10.2%) and lateral abdominal (right, +8.4%; 
      left, +7.0%) muscles on both sides increased after the crunch exercise (P < 
      0.01). Trunk lateral flexion resulted in increased ADC on only the right side of 
      all of the muscles (rectus abdominis, +12.3%; lateral abdominal muscles, +20.3%; 
      quadratus lumborum, +17.1%; intrinsic back muscles, +12.0%; psoas major, +15.4%) 
      (P < 0.01). The ADCs of the lateral abdominal (right, +5.2%; left, +5.6%), 
      quadratus lumborum (right, +6.0%; left, +3.0%), and intrinsic back (right, 
      +13.2%; left, +14.6%) muscles on both sides were elevated after trunk extension 
      (right lateral abdominal muscles and left quadratus lumborum, P < 0.05; other 
      muscles, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted imaging reveals the 
      recruitment patterns of superficial and deep trunk muscles in abdominal and back 
      exercises through exercise-induced activation in intramuscular water movement.

TI  - Metabolite diffusion in giant muscle fibers of the spiny lobster Panulirus argus.
PG  - 3377-86
AB  - The time- and orientation-dependence of metabolite diffusion in giant muscle 
      fibers of the lobster Panulirus argus was examined using (31)P- and 
      (1)H-pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance. The (31)P resonance for 
      arginine phosphate and the (1)H resonances for betaine, arginine/arginine 
      phosphate and -CH(2)/-CH groups were suitable for measurement of the apparent 
      diffusion coefficient, D. Diffusion was measured axially, D(//), and radially, D( 
      perpendicular ), in fibers over diffusion times of 20 to 300 ms. Diffusion was 
      strongly anisotropic, and D(//) was higher than D( perpendicular ) at all times. 
      Radial diffusion decreased with time until a steady-state value was reached at a 
      diffusion time of approximately 100 ms. Changes in D( perpendicular ) occurred 
      over a time scale that was consistent with previous measurements from fish and 
      mammalian muscle, indicating that diffusion is hindered by the same types of 
      barriers in these diverse muscle types. The time dependence indicated that the 
      sarcoplasmic reticulum is the principal intracellular structure that inhibits 
      mobility in an orientation-dependent manner in skeletal muscle. The abdominal 
      muscles in P. argus are used for anaerobic, burst contractions during an escape 
      maneuver. The fact that these muscle fibers have diameters that may exceed 
      hundreds of microns in diameter, and nearly all of the mitochondria are localized 
      near the sarcolemmal membrane, suggests that barriers that hinder radial 
      diffusion of ATP equivalents may ultimately limit the rate of post-contractile 
      recovery.

TI  - Assessment of diffusion tensor imaging indices in calf muscles following postural

LID - 10.1007/s10334-013-0424-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: To investigate whether postural change from erect to recumbent position 
      affects calf muscle water diffusivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy adults 
      (27.2 ± 4.9 years, 3 females) were imaged at baseline (following assumption of 
      recumbent position), and after 34 min (session 2) and 64 min (session 3) of 
      laying supine within a 3T MRI scanner. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      eigenvalues, fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 
      were evaluated in five calf muscles (anterior and posterior tibialis and triceps 
      surae) during each of the three imaging sessions. RESULTS: Significant decreases 
      were observed in all of the eigenvalues and ADC in each of the muscles with 
      postural change. These reductions ranged from 3.2 to 6.7% and 3.4 to 7.5% for the 
      various DTI metrics, following 34 and 64 min of supine rest, respectively (P < 
      0.05). No significant differences were noted in ADC or eigenvalues between the 
      second and third imaging sessions for any muscle. FA did not change significantly 
      with postural manipulation in any muscle compartment. CONCLUSION: Diffusion 
      tensor imaging indices were altered with postural change. As differences were not 
      apparent between the latter two imaging sessions, we suggest that a short supine 
      resting period (~34 min) is sufficient for muscle diffusivity to stabilize prior 
      to quantitative MR imaging in healthy young adults.

TI  - Diffusion Tensor MRI Assessment of Skeletal Muscle Architecture.
PG  - 152-160
AB  - Diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) offers great potential for 
      understanding structure-function relationships in skeletal muscle. The basis for 
      these studies is that water diffuses more readily along the long axes of muscle 
      fibers than along their transverse axes. This diffusion anisotropy can be 
      characterized using a tensor, with the orientation of the principal eigenvalue 
      corresponding to the long axis of the muscle fiber. These local, voxel-based 
      directions can be combined by a fiber tracking algorithm to reconstruct the 
      whole-muscle architecture. The fiber tracking data can be used to characterize 
      important muscle architectural parameters, such as pennation angle, fiber length, 
      and physiological cross-sectional area. The second and third eigenvalues convey 
      information about muscle structural properties along the fibers' transverse axes. 
      A comprehensive description of the sources of transverse diffusion restriction in 
      muscle and how their relative importance may vary with the image acquisition 
      conditions does not yet exist, but may ultimately make DTI a useful tool in 
      studies of skeletal muscle microstructure as well. Ultimately, DTI-based 
      longitudinal studies of changes in muscle architecture may provide insight into 
      the relationships between structure and function in muscle, the time frames of 
      muscle wasting, and in studying adaptations that maintain muscle functionality.

TI  - Application of diffusion microstructure imaging in musculoskeletal radiology - 
      translation from head to shoulders.
PG  - 1565-1574
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-09202-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Quantitative MRI techniques, such as diffusion microstructure imaging 
      (DMI), are increasingly applied for advanced tissue characterization. We 
      determined its value in rotator cuff (RC) muscle imaging by studying the 
      association of DMI parameters to isometric strength and fat fraction (FF). 
      METHODS: Healthy individuals prospectively underwent 3T-MRI of the shoulder using 
      DMI and chemical shift encoding-based water-fat imaging. RC muscles were 
      segmented and quantitative MRI metrics (V-ISO, free fluid; V-intra, compartment 
      inside of muscle fibers; V-extra, compartment outside of muscle fibers, and FF) 
      were extracted. Isometric shoulder strength was quantified using specific 
      clinical tests. Sex-related differences were assessed with Student's t. 
      Association of DMI-metrics, FF, and strength was tested. A factorial two-way 
      ANOVA was performed to compare the main effects of sex and external/internal 
      strength-ratio and their interaction effects on quantitative imaging parameters 
      ratios of infraspinatus/subscapularis. RESULTS: Among 22 participants (mean age: 
      26.7 ± 3.1 years, 50% female, mean BMI: 22.6 ± 1.9 kg/m(2)), FF of the individual 
      RC muscles did not correlate with strength or DMI parameters (all p > 0.05). 
      Subjects with higher V-intra (r = 0.57 to 0.87, p < 0.01) and lower V-ISO (r = 
      -0.6 to -0.88, p < 0.01) had higher internal and external rotation strength. 
      Moreover, V-intra was higher and V-ISO was lower in all RC muscles in males 
      compared to female subjects (all p < 0.01). There was a sex-independent 
      association of external/internal strength-ratio with the ratio of V-extra of 
      infraspinatus/subscapularis (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative DMI parameters 
      may provide incremental information about muscular function and microstructure in 
      young athletes and may serve as a potential biomarker. KEY POINTS: • Diffusion 
      microstructure imaging was successfully applied to non-invasively assess the 
      microstructure of rotator cuff muscles in healthy volunteers. • Sex-related 
      differences in the microstructural composition of the rotator cuff were observed. 
      • Muscular microstructural metrics correlated with rotator cuff strength and may 
      serve as an imaging biomarker of muscular integrity and function.

TI  - Analysis of Tongue Muscle Strain During Speech From Multimodal Magnetic Resonance 
      Imaging.
PG  - 513-526
LID - 10.1044/2022_JSLHR-22-00329 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Muscle groups within the tongue in healthy and diseased populations show 
      different behaviors during speech. Visualizing and quantifying strain patterns of 
      these muscle groups during tongue motion can provide insights into tongue motor 
      control and adaptive behaviors of a patient. METHOD: We present a pipeline to 
      estimate the strain along the muscle fiber directions in the deforming tongue 
      during speech production. A deep convolutional network estimates the crossing 
      muscle fiber directions in the tongue using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) data acquired at rest. A phase-based registration algorithm is used 
      to estimate motion of the tongue muscles from tagged MRI acquired during speech. 
      After transforming both muscle fiber directions and motion fields into a common 
      atlas space, strain tensors are computed and projected onto the muscle fiber 
      directions, forming so-called strains in the line of actions (SLAs) throughout 
      the tongue. SLAs are then averaged over individual muscles that have been 
      manually labeled in the atlas space using high-resolution T2-weighted MRI. Data 
      were acquired, and this pipeline was run on a cohort of eight healthy controls 
      and two glossectomy patients. RESULTS: The crossing muscle fibers reconstructed 
      by the deep network show orthogonal patterns. The strain analysis results 
      demonstrate consistency of muscle behaviors among some healthy controls during 
      speech production. The patients show irregular muscle patterns, and their tongue 
      muscles tend to show more extension than the healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      study showed visual evidence of correlation between two muscle groups during 
      speech production. Patients tend to have different strain patterns compared to 
      the controls. Analysis of variations in muscle strains can potentially help 
      develop treatment strategies in oral diseases. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL:

TI  - Demonstration of primary and secondary muscle fiber architecture of the bovine 
      tongue by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 1024-8
AB  - The myoarchitecture of the tongue is comprised of a complex array of muscle fiber 
      bundles, which form the structural basis for lingual deformations during speech 
      and swallowing. We used magnetic resonance imaging of the water diffusion tensor 
      to display the primary and secondary fiber architectural attributes of the 
      excised bovine tongue. Fiber orientation mapping provides a subdivision of the 
      tongue into its principal intrinsic and extrinsic muscular components. The 
      anterior tongue consists of a central region of orthogonally oriented intrinsic 
      fibers surrounded by an axially oriented muscular sheath. The posterior tongue 
      consists principally of a central region of extrinsic fibers, originating at the 
      inferior surface and projecting in a fan-like manner in the superior, lateral, 
      and posterior directions, and lateral populations of extrinsic fibers directed 
      posterior-inferior and posterior-superior. Analysis of cross-fiber anisotropy 
      indicates a basic contrast of design between the extrinsic and the intrinsic 
      fibers. Whereas the extrinsic muscles exhibit a uniaxial architecture typical of 
      skeletal muscle, the intrinsic core muscles, comprised of the verticalis and the 
      transversus muscles, show strong cross-fiber anisotropy. This pattern is 
      consistent with the theory that the tongue's core functions as a muscular 
      hydrostat in that conjoint contraction of the transverse and vertical fibers 
      enable the tissue to expand at right angles to these fibers. These findings 
      suggest that three-dimensional analysis of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance 
      imaging provides a structural basis for understanding the micromechanics of the 
      mammalian tongue.

TI  - Diffusional anisotropy is induced by subcellular barriers in skeletal muscle.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The time- and orientational-dependence of phosphocreatine (PCr) diffusion was 
      measured using pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) as a 
      means of non-invasively probing the intracellular diffusive barriers of skeletal 
      muscle. Red and white skeletal muscle from fish was used because fish muscle 
      cells are very large, which facilitates the examination of diffusional barriers 
      in the intracellular environment, and because they have regions of very 
      homogeneous fiber type. Fish were cold-acclimated (5 degrees C) to amplify the 
      contrast between red and white fibers. Apparent diffusion coefficients, D, were 
      measured axially, D(axially) and radially, D(radially), in small muscle strips 
      over a time course ranging from 12 to 700 ms. Radial diffusion was strongly time 
      dependent in both fiber types, and D decreased with time until a steady-state 
      value was reached at a diffusion time approximately 100 ms. Diffusion was also 
      highly anisotropic, with D(axially) being higher than D(radially) for all time 
      points. The time scale over which changes in D(radially) occurred indicated that 
      the observed anisotropy was not a result of interactions with the thick and thin 
      filament lattice of actin and myosin or restriction within the cylindrical 
      sarcolemma, as has been previously suggested. Rather, the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
      (SR) and mitochondria appear to be the principal intracellular structures that 
      inhibit mobility in an orientation-dependent manner. This work is the first 
      example of diffusional anisotropy induced by readily identifiable intracellular 
      structures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of skeletal muscles is 
      challenging due to the bias in DTI metrics, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) 
      and mean diffusivity (MD), related to insufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). 
      This study compares the bias of DTI metrics in skeletal muscles via pixel-based 
      and region-of-interest (ROI)-based analysis. METHODS: DTI of the thigh muscles 
      was conducted on a 3.0-T system in N = 11 volunteers using a fat-suppressed 
      single-shot spin-echo echo planar imaging (SS SE-EPI) sequence with eight 
      repetitions (number of signal averages (NSA) = 4 or 8 for each repeat). The SNR 
      was calculated for different NSAs and estimated for the composite images 
      combining all data (effective NSA = 48) as standard reference. The bias of MD and 
      FA derived by pixel-based and ROI-based quantification were compared at different 
      NSAs. An "intra-ROI diffusion direction dispersion angle (IRDDDA)" was calculated 
      to assess the uniformity of diffusion within the ROI. RESULTS: Using our standard 
      reference image with NSA = 48, the ROI-based and pixel-based measurements agreed 
      for FA and MD. Larger disagreements were observed for the pixel-based 
      quantification at NSA = 4. MD was less sensitive than FA to the noise level. The 
      IRDDDA decreased with higher NSA. At NSA = 4, ROI-based FA showed a lower average 
      bias (0.9% vs. 37.4%) and narrower 95% limits of agreement compared to the 
      pixel-based method. CONCLUSION: The ROI-based estimation of FA is less prone to 
      bias than the pixel-based estimations when SNR is low. The IRDDDA can be applied 
      as a quantitative quality measure to assess reliability of ROI-based DTI metrics.

TI  - Association between muscle hydration measures acquired using bioelectrical 
      impedance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging in healthy and hemodialysis 
      population.
LID - 10.14814/phy2.12219 [doi]
LID - e12219
AB  - Establishing the effect of fluctuating extracellular fluid (ECF) volume on muscle 
      strength in people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) is 
      essential, as inadequate hydration of the skeletal muscles impacts its strength 
      and endurance. Bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) has been a widely used 
      method for estimating ECF volume of a limb or calf segment. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI)-acquired transverse relaxation times (T2) has also been used for 
      estimating ECF volumes of individual skeletal muscles. The purpose of this study 
      was to determine the association between T2 (gold standard) of tibialis anterior 
      (TA), medial (MG), and lateral gastrocnemius (LG), and soleus muscles and calf 
      BIS ECF, in healthy and in people with ESRD/HD. Calf BIS and MRI measures were 
      collected on two occasions before and after HD session in people with ESRD/HD and 
      on a single occasion for the healthy participants. Linear regression analysis was 
      used to establish the association between these measures. Thirty-two healthy and 
      22 participants on HD were recruited. The association between T2 of TA, LG, MG, 
      and soleus muscles and ratio of calf BIS-acquired ECF and intracellular fluids 
      (ICF) were: TA: β = 0.30, P > 0.05; LG: β = 0.37, P = 0.035; MG: β = 0.43, P = 
      0.014; soleus: β = 0.60, P < 0.001. For the HD group, calf ECF was significantly 
      associated with T2 of TA (β = 0.44, P = 0.042), and medial gastrocnemius (β = 
      0.47, P = 0.027) following HD only. Hence BIS-acquired measures cannot be used to 
      measure ECF volumes of a single muscle in the ESRD/HD population; however, BIS 
      could be utilized to estimate ratio of ECF: ICF in healthy population for the LG, 
      MG, and soleus muscles.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging in evaluation of human skeletal muscle injury.
PG  - 402-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the capability and reliability of diffusion tensor magnetic 
      resonance imaging (DTI) in the evaluation of human skeletal muscle injury. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI of four patients with gastrocnemius and soleus muscles 
      injuries was compared to eight healthy controls. Imaging was performed using a GE 
      3.0T short-bore scanner. A diffusion-weighted 2D spin echo echo-planar imaging 
      (EPI) pulse sequence optimized for skeletal muscle was used. From a series of 
      axially acquired diffusion tensor images the diffusion tensor eigenparameters 
      (eigenvalues and eigenvectors), fractional anisotropy (FA), and apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated and compared for injured and healthy 
      calf muscles. Two dimensional (2D) projection maps of the principal eigenvectors 
      were plotted to visualize the healthy and pathologic muscle fiber architectures. 
      RESULTS: Clear differences in FA and ADC were observed in injured skeletal 
      muscle, compared to healthy controls. Mean control FA was 0.23 +/- 0.02 for 
      medial and lateral gastrocnemius (mg and lg) muscles, and 0.20 +/- 0.02 for 
      soleus (sol) muscles. In all patients FA values were reduced compared to 
      controls, to as low as 0.08 +/- 0.02. The ADC in controls ranged from 1.41 to 
      1.31 x 10(-9) m(2)/second, while in patients this was consistently higher. The 2D 
      projection maps revealed muscle fiber disorder in injured calves, while in 
      healthy controls the 2D projection maps show a well organized (ordered) fiber 
      structure. CONCLUSION: DTI is a suitable method to assess human calf muscle 
      injury.

TI  - Restricted or severely hindered diffusion of intramyocellular lipids in human 
      skeletal muscle shown by in vivo proton MR spectroscopy.
PG  - 310-6
LID - 10.1002/mrm.23024 [doi]
AB  - Although magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used as a unique tool to study 
      molecular diffusion, it is rarely used to measure the diffusion properties of 
      intramyocellular and extramyocellular lipids. Lipids have very low apparent 
      diffusion coefficients (ADCs), which make these measurements difficult and 
      necessitate strong diffusion gradients and long diffusion times. Consequence is 
      that these measurements have inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and are prone 
      to artifacts. The addition of physiological triggering and individual storage and 
      processing of the spectra is seen to be a possible approach to maximize signal 
      intensity and achieve high reproducibility of the experiments. Thus, the 
      optimized measurement protocol was used to investigate the diffusion properties 
      of lipids in human skeletal muscle in vivo. At a diffusion time of about 110 ms, 
      intramyocellular lipids show a significantly lower ADC (2.0 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.10 × 10(-6) to 2.94 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s) than extramyocellular 
      lipids (1.58 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s, 95% confidence interval 1.41 × 10(-5) to 1.75 × 
      10(-5) mm(2)/s). Because the chemical properties of both lipid pools can be 
      assumed to be similar, the difference can only be attributed to restricted or 
      severely hindered diffusion in the intramyocellular droplets.

      contralateral limb have not been investigated. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective 
      cohort study enrolled patients who underwent supermicrosurgical LVA between 
      November 2015 and January 2017. Pre- and post-LVA muscle edema were assessed 
      using fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The 
      primary endpoint was changes in limb/subfascial volume assessed with magnetic 
      resonance volumetry at least 6 months after LVA. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients 
      were enrolled in this study. Significant percentage reductions in post-LVA muscle 
      edema were found in the affected thigh (83.6% [interquartile range = range of Q1 
      to Q3; 29.8-137.1] [FA], 53.3% [27.0-78.4] [ADC]) as well as limb (21.7% 
      [4.4-26.5]) and subfascial (18.7% [10.7-39.1]) volumes. Similar findings were 
      noted in the affected lower leg: 71.8% [44.0-100.1] (FA), 59.1% [45.8-91.2] 
      (ADC), 21.2% [6.8-38.2], and 28.2% [8.5-44.8], respectively (all p < 0.001). 
      Significant alleviation of muscle edema was also evident in the contralateral 
      limbs (thigh: 25.1% [20.4-57.5] [FA]; 10.7% [6.6-17.7] [ADC]; lower leg: 47.1% 
      [35.0-62.8] [FA]; 14.6% [6.5-22.1] [ADC]; both p < 0.001), despite no 
      statistically significant difference in limb and subfascial volumes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study found significant reductions in muscle edema and limb/subfascial 
      volumes in the affected limb after LVA. Our findings regarding edema in the 
      contralateral limb were consistent with possible lymphedema-associated systemic 
      influence on the unaffected limb, which could be surgically relieved.

AB  - The purpose of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of intravoxel 
      incoherent motion imaging (IVIM) for non-invasive quantification of perfusion and 
      diffusion effects in skeletal muscle at rest and following exercise. After IRB 
      approval, eight healthy volunteers underwent diffusion-weighted MRI of the 
      forearm at 3 T and eight different b values between 0 and 500 s/mm(2) with a 
      temporal resolution of 57 s per dataset. Dynamic images were acquired before and 
      after a standardized handgrip exercise. Diffusion (D) and pseudodiffusion (D*) 
      coefficients as well as the perfusion fraction (FP ) were measured in regions of 
      interest in the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus (FDS/FDP), 
      brachioradialis, and extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis muscles by using a 
      multi-step bi-exponential analysis in MATLAB. Parametrical maps were calculated 
      voxel-wise. Differences in D, D*, and FP between muscle groups and between time 
      points were calculated using a repeated measures analysis of variance with post 
      hoc Bonferroni tests. Mean values and standard deviations at rest were the 
      following: D*, 28.5 ± 11.4 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; FP , 0.03 ± 0.01; D, 
      1.45 ± 0.09 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s. Changes of IVIM parameters were clearly visible on 
      the parametrical maps. In the FDS/FDP, D* increased by 289 ± 236% (p < 0.029), FP 
      by 138 ± 58% (p < 0.01), and D by 17 ± 9% (p < 0.01). A significant increase of 
      IVIM parameters could also be detected in the brachioradialis muscle, which 
      however was significantly lower than in the FDS/FDP. After 20 min, all parameters 
      were still significantly elevated in the FDS/FDP but not in the brachioradialis 
      muscle compared with the resting state. The IVIM approach allows simultaneous 
      quantification of muscle perfusion and diffusion effects at rest and following 
      exercise. It may thus provide a useful alternative to other non-invasive methods 
      such as arterial spin labeling. Possible fields of interest for this technique 
      include perfusion-related muscle diseases, such as peripheral arterial occlusive 
      disease.

AB  - Twelve healthy subjects underwent hydrogen-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
      ([Formula: see text]) acquisition ([Formula: see text]), diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) with a [Formula: see text]-value of [Formula: see text], and fat-water 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the Dixon method. Subject-specific muscle 
      fiber orientation, derived from DTI, was used to estimate the lipid proton 
      spectral chemical shift. Pennation angles were measured as 23.78 deg in vastus 
      lateralis (VL), 17.06 deg in soleus (SO), and 8.49 deg in tibialis anterior (TA) 
      resulting in a chemical shift between extramyocellular lipids (EMCL) and 
      intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) of 0.15, 0.17, and 0.19 ppm, respectively. IMCL 
      concentrations were [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see 
      text] in SO, VL, and TA, respectively. Significant differences were observed in 
      IMCL and EMCL pairwise comparisons in SO, VL, and TA ([Formula: see text]). 
      Strong correlations were observed between total fat fractions from [Formula: see 
      text] and Dixon MRI for VL ([Formula: see text]), SO ([Formula: see text]), and 
      TA ([Formula: see text]). Bland-Altman analysis between fat fractions (FFMRS and 
      FFMRI) showed good agreement with small limits of agreement (LoA): [Formula: see 
      text] (LoA: [Formula: see text] to 0.69%) in VL, [Formula: see text] (LoA: 
      [Formula: see text] to 1.33%) in SO, and [Formula: see text] (LoA: [Formula: see 
      text] to 0.47%) in TA. The results of this study demonstrate the variation in 
      muscle fiber orientation and lipid concentrations in these three skeletal muscle 
      types.

TI  - Application of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Fiber Tractography for Human Masseter 
      Muscle.
PG  - 151-160
LID - 10.1620/tjem.256.151 [doi]
AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to indicate the direction of nerve 
      and muscle fibers by using the characteristics that water molecules 
      preferentially diffuse along the fibrous structure. However, DTI fiber 
      tractography for multipennate muscles, such as the masseter muscle, is 
      challenging due to a lack of data regarding the imaging parameters. This study 
      aimed to determine the optimal DTI parameters for masseter muscle fiber 
      tractography. A 27-year-old healthy man voluntarily underwent DTI and T1-weighted 
      magnetic resonance imaging of the right masseter muscle. Four imaging parameter 
      settings were created by combining the following parameters that particularly 
      affect the signal-to-noise ratio: b-value, number of excitations (NEX), and 
      number of motion probing gradient (MPG) directions. DTI fiber tractography was 
      performed using specific software for each parameter setting. The length and 
      orientation of the muscle fibers in each layer were calculated. As a result, the 
      masseter muscle fibers of each layer were identified on DTI. Although the 
      detected fiber length was affected significantly by the imaging parameters, the 
      fiber orientation was insignificantly affected. The appropriate combination of 
      the b-value, NEX, and the number of MPG directions for masseter muscle fiber 
      tractography could be determined based on previously reported anatomical data of 
      the masseter muscle fibers. DTI may enable the non-invasive evaluation of 
      masseter muscle fiber length and orientation. Elucidation of the details of 
      masseter muscle fiber orientation is useful in evaluating stomatognathic 
      biomechanics and muscle disorders.

TI  - Age Differences in Recovery Rate Following an Aerobic-Based Exercise Protocol 
      Inducing Muscle Damage Among Amateur, Male Athletes.
PG  - 916924
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.916924 [doi]
LID - 916924
AB  - Purpose: Compare recovery rates between active young (Y) and middle-aged (MA) 
      males up to 48H post aerobically based, exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) 
      protocol. A secondary aim was to explore the relationships between changes in 
      indices associated with EIMD and recovery throughout this timeframe. Methods: 
      Twenty-eight Y (n = 14, 26.1 ± 2.9y, 74.5 ± 9.3 kg) and MA (n = 14, 43.6 ± 4.1y, 
      77.3 ± 12.9 kg) physically active males, completed a 60-min downhill running 
      (DHR) on a treadmill at -10% incline and at 65% of maximal heart rate (HR). 
      Biochemical, biomechanical, psychological, force production and muscle integrity 
      (using MRI diffusion tensor imaging) markers were measured at baseline, 
      immediately-post, and up to 48H post DHR. Results: During the DHR, HR was lower 
      (p < 0.05) in MA compared to Y, but running pace and distance covered were 
      comparable between groups. No statistical or meaningful differences were observed 
      between groups for any of the outcomes. Yet, Significant (p < 0.05) time-effects 
      within each group were observed: markers of muscle damage, cadence and perception 
      of pain increased, while TNF-a, isometric and dynamic force production and 
      stride-length decreased. Creatine-kinase at 24H-post and 48H-post were correlated 
      (p < 0.05, r range = -0.57 to 0.55) with pain perception, stride-length, and 
      cadence at 24H-post and 48H-post. Significant (p < 0.05) correlations were 
      observed between isometric force production at all time-points and IL-6 at 
      48H-post DHR (r range = -0.62 to (-0.74). Conclusion: Y and MA active male 
      amateur athletes recover in a comparable manner following an EIMD downhill

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the possible brain structural and functional alterations in 
      congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1) patients using 
      multimodal MRI imaging. METHODS: T1-weighted, diffusion tensor images and 
      functional MRI data were obtained from 9 KIF21A positive patients and 19 age- and 
      gender-matched healthy controls. Voxel based morphometry and tract based spatial 
      statistics were applied to the T1-weighted and diffusion tensor images, 
      respectively. Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations and regional homogeneity 
      were used to process the functional MRI data. We then compared these multimodal 
      characteristics between CFEOM1 patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: Compared 
      with healthy controls, CFEOM1 patients demonstrated increased grey matter volume 
      in bilateral frontal orbital cortex and in the right temporal pole. No diffusion 
      indices changes were detected, indicating unaffected white matter microstructure. 
      In addition, from resting state functional MRI data, trend of amplitude of 
      low-frequency fluctuations increases were noted in the right inferior parietal 
      lobe and in the right frontal cortex, and a trend of ReHo increase (p<0.001 
      uncorrected) in the left precentral gyrus, left orbital frontal cortex, temporal 
      pole and cingulate gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: CFEOM1 patients had structural and 
      functional changes in grey matter, but the white matter was unaffected. These 
      alterations in the brain may be due to the abnormality of extraocular muscles and 
      their innervating nerves. Future studies should consider the possible 
      correlations between brain morphological/functional findings and clinical data, 
      especially pertaining to eye movements, to obtain more precise answers about the 
      role of brain area changes and their functional consequence in CFEOM1.

AB  - We aimed to detect physiologic changes of leg muscle signal on magnetic resonance 
      (MR) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in asymptomatic subjects after repetitive 
      plantar flexion exercises. In this monocentric prospective study, DWI of both 
      legs were performed at rest and after exercise periods (5 min, Ex(5): and 10 min, 
      Ex(10)) in 20 active healthy subjects (mean age 31 years). The exercise consisted 
      in repetitive plantar flexion of the right foot using elastic band, the patient 
      being sited directly on the MR table. Both visual semiquantitative evaluations 
      and quantitative (apparent diffusion coefficient, ADC; fractional anisotropy, FA) 
      were performed in 5 leg compartments. Visually, signal changes involved mainly 
      the fibular and gastrocnemius muscles and were considered intense after Ex(5) in 
      3 subjects, moderate only after Ex(5) in 10, and moderate only after Ex(10) in 4. 
      No changes were visible in 3 subjects. Quantitative evaluation confirmed 
      significant signal changes in the fibular (ADC: + 17.4%, p < 0.001; FA: -8.3%, 
      p = 0.030) and gastrocnemius (ADC: + 13.7%, p < 0.001; FA: -11.4%, p < 0.001) 
      muscles between rest and post-exercise MR. Plantar flexion exercises induce 
      changes on DWI, especially in fibular and gastrocnemius muscles, which can be 
      visually and quantitatively detectable in asymptomatic active subjects.Trial

TI  - Diffusion as a Natural Contrast in MR Imaging of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) 
      Tissue Changes. A Case Study of the Clinical Application of DTI for a Patient 
      with Chronic Calf Muscles Ischemia.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics11010092 [doi]
LID - 92
AB  - This paper reports a first application of diffusion tensor imaging with 
      corrections by using the B-matrix spatial distribution method (BSD-DTI) for 
      peripheral artery disease (PAD) detected in the changes of diffusion tensor 
      parameters (DTPs). A 76-year-old male was diagnosed as having PAD, since he 
      demonstrated in angiographic images of lower legs severe arterial stenosis and 
      the presence of lateral and peripheral circulation and assigned to the 
      double-blind RCT using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or placebo for the 
      regenerative treatment of implications of ischemic diseases. In order to indicate 
      changes in diffusivity in calf muscles in comparison to a healthy control, a DTI 
      methodology was developed. The main advantage of the applied protocol was 
      decreased scanning time, which was achieved by reducing b-value and number of 
      scans (to 1), while maintaining minimal number of diffusion gradient directions 
      and high resolution. This was possible due to calibration via the BSD method, 
      which reduced systematic errors and allowed quantitative analysis. In the course 
      of PAD, diffusivities were elevated across the calf muscles in posterior 
      compartment and lost their anisotropy. Different character was noticed for 
      anterior compartment, in which diffusivities along and across muscles were 
      decreased without a significant loss of anisotropy. After the intervention 
      involving a series of injections, the improvement of DTPs and tractography was 
      visible, but can be assigned neither to MSCs nor placebo before unblinding.

TI  - Psoas muscle metastasis from cervical carcinoma: Correlation and comparison of 
      diagnostic features on FDG-PET/CT and diffusion-weighted MRI.
PG  - 125-9
LID - 10.4329/wjr.v6.i4.125 [doi]
AB  - Psoas muscle metastasis, though rare, is the commonest site of skeletal muscle 
      involvement in cervical carcinoma. The appropriate clinical management of this 
      condition, particularly of the pain related to malignant psoas syndrome, is still 
      evolving and the diagnostic features on conventional morphological imaging 
      modalities are often non specific, with the differential diagnosis lying between 
      sarcoma, hematoma, and abscess. In this report, a comparison of various 
      morphofunctional imaging modalities was made. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron 
      emission tomography (FDG-PET)/computed tomography (CT) was the first to suspect 
      disease involvement of the psoas muscle, demonstrating intense FDG uptake 
      (compared with the contralateral muscle), while ultrasound showed heterogeneous 
      echotexture, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed subtle altered signal 
      intensity in the right psoas muscle. Both anatomical imaging modalities and non 
      contrast CT of the PET-CT examination demonstrated a bulky psoas muscle, without 
      any focal abnormality. On diffusion-weighted imaging of MRI (DWI-MRI), restricted 
      diffusion of the involved muscle was an important observation. The psoas muscle 
      metastatic involvement was proven histopathologically. Thus, enhanced glucose 
      metabolism and restricted diffusion in the newer non-invasive molecular imaging 
      modalities (e.g., PET/CT and DWI-MRI) could serve as valuable adjunctive 
      parameters in diagnosing this entity in the absence of a focal abnormality in the 
      anatomical modalities. In the treatment response monitoring scenario, FDG-PET/CT 
      demonstrated near complete resolution following administration of 3 cycles of 
      systemic chemotherapy and local external radiotherapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) characteristics of thigh 
      muscles in patients with polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM). METHODS: 12 
      patients with known PM/DM and 10 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. 
      Both DTI and conventional MR sequences were performed on both thighs of all 
      subjects. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA) and 
      three eigenvalues were compared between the PM/DM group and the healthy group. 
      One-way analysis of variance and Student's t-test were used for statistical 
      analyses with a significance of p < 0.05. RESULTS: In the healthy group, the 
      vastus intermedius muscle showed the highest ADC value and the gracilis (GA) 
      muscle showed the lowest ADC value. These results were statistically significant 
      when compared with other muscles (p < 0.05). The GA, semi-tendinosus and 
      semi-membranosus muscles showed higher FA values than the other three thigh 
      muscles (p < 0.05). The mean ADC value and three eigenvalues of oedematous 
      muscles in the PM/DM group were higher on average and showed a statistically 
      significant difference when compared with unaffected (non-oedematous muscles in 
      patients) and normal muscles (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in 
      the mean FA value between oedematous and normal muscles. The mean ADC, FA and 
      three eigenvalues in unaffected muscles (in patients) showed no statistical 
      differences from those in normal muscles (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: DTI can be used 
      to quantitatively evaluate the anisotropic diffusion characteristics of muscles 
      in patients with PM/DM. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: A new application of DTI is 
      proposed for inflammatory myopathies. The results show that ADC and the three 
      eigenvalues were significantly different between diseased and normal muscles, a 
      finding of potential value in both diagnosis and treatment monitoring of 
      myopathies.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging combined with T2 mapping to quantify changes in the 
      skeletal muscle associated with training and endurance exercise in competitive 
      triathletes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) and T2 mapping 
      enable the detection of exercise-induced changes in the skeletal muscle 
      microenvironment. This study prospectively quantified DTI metrics and T2 
      relaxation times of thigh muscles in competitive triathletes at rest and 
      following a triathlon race in comparison with sedentary controls. METHODS: 
      Twenty-two triathletes (males N = 16, females N = 6) and twenty-three controls 
      (males N = 16, females N = 7) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 3 T 
      system at baseline (time point 1; 72 h at rest). Twelve triathletes (males N = 8, 
      females N = 4) underwent a second scan (time point 2; 3 h of completing a 
      triathlon race). The tensor eigenvalues (λ(1), λ(2), λ(3)), mean diffusivity 
      (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and T2 times were compared between controls and 
      triathletes at time point 1 and triathletes at time points 1 and 2 using 
      independent and paired t tests. RESULTS: In comparison with the controls at time 
      point 1, the T2 times of rectus femoris (RF, p < 0.02), adductor magnus (AM, 
      p = 0.02), biceps femoris (BF, p < 0.001), semitendinosus (ST, p = 0.005), and 
      semimembranosus (SM, p = 0.003) muscles were significantly increased in 
      triathletes. At time point 2 in triathletes, the average tensor metrics (MD, 
      λ(3)/ λ(1)) of BF, ST, and SM muscles increased (p < 0.05) and FA values in ST 
      and SM muscles decreased (p < 0.03). T2 times were not significantly changed 
      between both time points in triathletes. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that 
      this multiparametric MRI protocol allows detection and quantification of changes 
      in the skeletal muscle microenvironment caused by endurance training and acute 
      strenuous exercise. KEY POINTS: • Endurance training results in changes to the 
      skeletal microstructure, which can be quantified using MRI-based diffusion tensor 
      imaging. • The combined application of MRI diffusion tensor imaging and T2 
      mapping allows the differentiation of microstructural changes caused by active 
      exercise or endurance training. • Environmental adaptations of the skeletal 
      muscle caused by physical training are influenced by gender.

AB  - Important physiological quantities for investigating muscle hypertrophy include 
      blood oxygenation, cell swelling, and changes in blood flow. The purpose of this 
      study was to compare the acute changes of these parameters in human skeletal 
      muscle induced by low-load (20% 1-RM) blood flow-restricted (BFR-20) knee 
      extensor exercise compared with free-flow work-matched (FF-20(WM)) and free-flow 
      50% 1-RM (FF-50) knee extensor exercise using multimodal magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI). Subjects (n = 11) completed acute exercise sessions for each 
      exercise mode in an MRI scanner, where interleaved measures of muscle R(2) 
      (indicator of edema), [Formula: see text] (indicator of deoxyhemoglobin), 
      macrovascular blood flow, and diffusion were performed before, between sets, and 
      after the final set for each exercise protocol. BFR-20 exercise resulted in 
      larger acute decreases in R(2) and greater increases in cross-sectional area than 
      FF-20(WM) and FF-50 (P < 0.01). Blood oxygenation decreased between sets during 
      BFR-20, as indicated by a 13.6% increase in [Formula: see text] values (P < 
      0.01)), whereas they remained unchanged for FF-20(WM) and decreased during FF-50 
      exercise. Quadriceps blood flow between sets was highest for the heavier load 
      (FF-50), averaging 305 mL/min, and lowest for BFR-20 at 123 ± 73 mL/min until 
      post-exercise cuff release, where blood flow rates in BFR-20 exceeded both FF 
      protocols (P < 0.01). Acute changes in diffusion rates were similar for all 
      exercise protocols. This study was able to differentiate the acute exercise 
      response of selected physiological factors associated with skeletal muscle 
      hypertrophy. Marked differences in these parameters were found to exist between 
      BFR and FF exercise conditions, which contribute to explain the anabolic 
      potential of low-load blood flow restricted muscle exercise.NEW & NOTEWORTHY 
      Acute changes in blood flow, diffusion, blood oxygenation, cross-sectional area, 
      and the "T(2) shift" are evaluated in human skeletal muscle in response to blood 
      flow-restricted (BFR) and conventional free-flow knee extensor exercise performed 
      in an MRI scanner. The acute physiological response to exercise was dependent on 
      the magnitude of load and the application of BFR. Physiological variables changed 
      markedly and established a steady state rapidly after the first of four exercise 
      sets.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging of the human calf muscle: distinct changes in fractional 
      anisotropy and mean diffusion due to passive muscle shortening and stretching.
PG  - 1047-53
LID - 10.1002/nbm.1409 [doi]
AB  - The influence of passive shortening and stretching of the calf muscles on 
      diffusion characteristics was investigated. The diffusion tensor was measured in 
      transverse slices through the lower leg of eight healthy volunteers (29 +/- 7 
      years) on a 3 T whole-body MR unit in three different positions of the foot (40 
      degrees plantarflexion, neutral ankle position (0 degrees ), and -10 degrees 
      dorsiflexion in the ankle). Maps of the mean diffusivity, the three eigenvalues 
      of the tensor and fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated. Results revealed a 
      distinct dependence of the mean diffusivity and FA on the foot position and the 
      related shortening and stretching of the muscle groups. The tibialis anterior 
      muscle showed a significant increase of 19% in FA with increasing dorsiflexion, 
      while the FA of the antagonists significantly decreased ( approximately 20%). 
      Regarding the mean diffusivity of the diffusion tensor, the muscle groups showed 
      an opposed response to muscle elongation and shortening. Regarding the 
      eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor, lambda(2) and lambda(3) showed significant 
      changes in relation to muscle length. In contrast, no change in lambda(1) could 
      be found. This work reveals significant changes in diffusional characteristics 
      induced by passive muscle shortening and stretching.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The distribution of energy use among different lower limb muscles 
      during walking and running is not well understood. Local blood flow within 
      skeletal muscle tissue depends on its metabolic activity during activation. The 
      non-invasive magnetic resonance microvascular perfusion method Intravoxel 
      Incoherent Motion (IVIM) is able to quantify muscle activation. PURPOSE: To 
      non-invasively determine quantitative changes in local microvascular perfusion 
      and blood flow via IVIM in order to characterize specific muscle activation of 
      the lower limb at rest, during walking and during running. METHODS: 3 T MR IVIM 
      diffusion-weighted images of N = 16 lower extremities (bilateral imaging of n = 8 
      healthy volunteers; mean age 27.5 ± 5.7 years) were acquired at rest and 
      immediately after walking and running for 15 min, respectively. A transverse 
      monopolar pulsed gradient fat suppressed spin echo EPI sequence was used (9 
      b-values from 0 to 1000s/mm(2), 3 orthogonal directions). Anatomical transverse 
      T1-weighted turbo SE images were acquired at rest. Muscles at the pelvis, thigh 
      and lower leg were segmented. IVIM perfusion parameters f, D* and fD* and the 
      diffusion coefficient D were obtained after standard two-steps fitting of the 
      IVIM bi-exponential signal equation. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, Pearson's 
      correlations and Partial Spearman correlations were used for statistical 
      analyses. RESULTS: The microvascular blood flow (fD*) increased significantly and 
      stepwise from rest (1.65 ± 0.83*10(-3) mm(2)/s) to walking 
      (1.99 ± 0.80*10(-3) mm(2)/s, P < 0.001) and running (2.18 ± 0.98*10(-3) mm(2)/s, 
      P < 0.001). The perfusion increase was most pronounced for lower leg and feet 
      muscles (P < 0.001). Hamstring muscles showed a higher microvascular perfusion 
      increase than quadriceps muscles (P < 0.05). A higher increase of the heartrate 
      from walking to running correlated significantly with a lower increase of fD* 
      from walking to running (R = -0.16, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: IVIM MRI 
      quantitatively measures local microvascular muscle perfusion to detect muscle 
      activation patterns through walking and running. A redistribution of blood flow 
      towards the lower leg was observed during running as compared to walking.

TI  - Metabolic and Structural Skeletal Muscle Health in Systemic Lupus 
      Erythematosus-Related Fatigue: A Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.
PG  - 1640-1646
LID - 10.1002/acr.23833 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential structural and metabolic role of skeletal 
      muscle in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-related fatigue. METHODS: A 
      case-control, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was conducted. 
      Cases were patients with inactive SLE who reported chronic fatigue. Controls were 
      age- and sex-matched healthy members of the general population. Patients were 
      clinically characterized and then underwent a 3T whole-body MRI scan. Resting and 
      dynamic (31) P MRI spectroscopy of the calf muscles was applied, from which 
      phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery halftime, a marker of mitochondrial dysfunction, 
      was computed. In addition, microstructural sequences (T1-weighted anatomic 
      images, T2 mapping, and diffusion tensor imaging) were acquired. Descriptive 
      statistics evaluated group differences and within-case physical fatigue 
      correlations were explored. RESULTS: Of the 37 recruits (mean age 43.8 years, 
      89.2% female), cases (n = 19) reported higher levels of physical fatigue, pain, 
      depression, and sleep disturbance compared to the control group (P < 0.0001). PCr 
      was greater (P = 0.045) among cases (mean ± SD 33.0 ± 9.0 seconds) compared to 
      controls (mean ± SD 27.1 ± 6.6 seconds). No microstructural group differences 
      were observed. Within cases, physical fatigue did not correlate with PCr (r = 
      -0.28, P = 0.25). CONCLUSION: We report preliminary data demonstrating greater 
      skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction among fatigued patients with SLE 
      compared to healthy controls.

TI  - Age-related changes in skeletal muscle as detected by diffusion tensor magnetic 
      resonance imaging.
PG  - 453-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss of muscle mass and strength is a common symptom in the elderly 
      population. This is partly a result of the structural changes that occur during 
      the aging process. We applied diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI) 
      to determine if water diffusivity in skeletal muscle changes with age. METHODS: 
      Thirty-eight healthy men, ranging from 27 to 67 years of age, were recruited for 
      this study. The total population was grouped by age (Young < mean age 46.4: n = 
      20; Old > or = mean age 46.4: n = 18) and body mass index (BMI; Normal < 25: n = 
      20; Over > or =25: n = 18). The principal, second, and third eigenvalues 
      (lambda(1) > or = lambda(2) > or = lambda(3)), and fractional anisotropy (FA), 
      were calculated from the diffusion tensor of the soleus, lateral and medial 
      gastrocnemius, and anterior tibialis (AT). Analyses included comparison of groups 
      and linear regressions. RESULTS: The older adults showed a significant reduction 
      in the eigenvalues of the plantar flexors ( approximately 7%, p <.05) and FA of 
      AT ( approximately 10%, p <.05) from that of the younger adults. No age 
      differences were observed in the FA of the plantar flexors or eigenvalues of AT. 
      lambda(1) and lambda(2) had a linear dependence on age in the plantar flexors, 
      whereas AT showed age dependence in lambda(3) and FA. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      demonstrated that DTMRI is sensitive to age-related changes in muscle, and that 
      the effects of aging differ between the plantar flexors and AT.

TI  - Quantitative effects of inclusion of fat on muscle diffusion tensor MRI 
      measurements.
PG  - 1292-7
LID - 10.1002/jmri.24045 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the minimum water percentage in a muscle region of interest 
      that would allow diffusion tensor (DT-) MRI data to reflect the diffusion 
      properties of pure muscle accurately. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proton 
      density-weighted images with and without fat saturation were obtained at the 
      mid-thigh in four subjects. Co-registered DT-MR images were used to calculate the 
      diffusion tensor's eigenvalues and fractional anisotropy. RESULTS: The 
      eigenvalues transitioned monotonically as a function of water signal percentage 
      from values near to those expected for pure fat to those for pure muscle. Also, 
      the fractional anisotropy transitioned monotonically from 0.50 (fat) to 0.20 
      (muscle). For water signal percentages >55%, none of the diffusion indices 
      differed significantly from those for regions of >90% muscle. CONCLUSION: 
      Accounting for the T1 and T2 values of muscle and fat and the pulse sequence 
      properties, it is concluded that, as a conservative estimate, regions must 
      contain at least 76% muscle tissue to reflect the diffusion properties of pure 
      muscle accurately.

TI  - Alterations in intramuscular water movement associated with mechanical changes in 
      human skeletal muscle fibers: an evaluation using magnetic resonance 
      diffusion-weighted imaging and B-mode ultrasonography.
PG  - 1003-8
LID - 10.1258/ar.2011.110153 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intramuscular water movement is expected to be affected by the 
      mechanical changes of the muscle fibers. However, the effect of changes in fiber 
      length (FL) and pennation angle (PA) on the water movement has not been 
      sufficiently investigated in human skeletal muscles. PURPOSE: To determine the 
      relationship between intramuscular water movement and the mechanical changes in 
      human muscle fibers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Axial magnetic resonance 
      diffusion-weighted images of the right leg (eight men) were taken using a 
      1.5-Tesla device with the ankle joint maximally dorsiflexed and maximally plantar 
      flexed. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of both the dorsiflexors 
      (the superficial and deep parts of the tibialis anterior) and the plantar flexors 
      (medial gastrocnemius and soleus) were calculated along three orthogonal axes 
      (S-I: superior-to-inferior, A-P: anterior-to-posterior, and R-L: right-to-left). 
      FL and PA of both muscle groups were also calculated from longitudinal B-mode 
      ultrasound images with the ankle joint maximally dorsiflexed and plantar flexed. 
      RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the ADC in superficial (P < 0.05) 
      and deep (P < 0.05) parts of the dorsiflexors in the S-I direction when the ankle 
      was plantar flexed and in the A-P and R-L directions when the ankle was 
      dorsiflexed (P < 0.05). The plantar flexors showed significantly elevated ADC in 
      the S-I direction when the ankle was dorsiflexed (P < 0.05), and in the A-P and 
      R-L directions when the ankle was plantar flexed (P < 0.05). The dorsiflexors 
      also showed significantly increased PA and decreased FL values when the ankle was 
      dorsiflexed (P < 0.05). The plantar flexors displayed similar morphological 
      changes when the ankle was plantar flexed (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Water diffusion 
      is affected by structural changes in the long axis of the muscle fibers, namely 
      the changes in PA and FL.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively evaluate diffusion and perfusion status of lateral 
      pterygoid muscle (LPM) in patients with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) by 
      intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging and to correlate with findings on 
      temporomandibular joints (TMJs) by conventional MRI. METHODS: 42 patients with 
      TMD underwent MRI. To assess IVIM parameters, diffusion-weighted imaging was 
      obtained by spin-echo-based single-shot echoplanar imaging. Regions of interest 
      were created on all diffusion-weighted images of the superior belly of the 
      lateral pterygoid (SLP) and inferior belly of the lateral pterygoid (ILP) at 
      b-values 0-500 s mm(-2). Then, IVIM parameters, diffusion (D) and perfusion (f) 
      were calculated using biexponential fittings. The correlation of these values 
      with conventional MRI findings on TMJs was investigated. RESULTS: For SLP, the f 
      parameter in TMJs with anterior disc displacement without reduction was 
      significantly higher than that in normal ones (p = 0.015). It was also 
      significantly higher in TMJs with joint effusion than in those without 
      (p = 0.016). On the other hand, for both SLP and ILP, the D parameter 
      significantly increased in TMJs with osteoarthritis compared with those without 
      (p = 0.015 and p = 0.022, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Pathological changes of LPM 
      in patients with TMD may be quantitatively evaluated by IVIM parameters.

TI  - Comparison of reduced field-of-view DWI and full field-of view DWI for the 
      differentiation between non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and muscle invasive 
      bladder cancer using VI-RADS.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate whether reduced field-of-view (rFOV) DWI sequence improves 
      the differentiation between non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and 
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) using VI-RADS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Eighty-nine patients underwent bladder MRI with full field-of-view (fFOV) DWI and 
      rFOV DWI sequence. Images were independently evaluated by 2 radiologists. The 
      sensitivities, specificities, accuracies, and areas under the curve (AUCs) for 
      the differentiation between NMIBC and MIBC with fFOV DWI and with rFOV DWI 
      sequence were calculated using VI-RADS. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) 
      values were measured for each patient and averaged. RESULTS: The sensitivity, 
      specificity, accuracy, and AUC by reader 1 were 92%, 78%, 82% and 0.905 with fFOV 
      DWI, and 92%, 86%, 88% and 0.916 with rFOV DWI sequence, respectively. The 
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC by reader 2 were 96%, 76%, 82% and 
      0.900 with conventional DWI, and 96%, 81%, 85% and 0.907 with rFOV DWI sequence, 
      respectively. The specificity and accuracy of reader 1 were significantly better 
      with rFOV DWI sequence than with fFOV DWI, in contrast there was no significant 
      difference for the others. The average of ADC values of fFOV DWI and rFOV DWI 
      sequence were 1.004×10-6 mm2/s and 1.003×10-6 mm2/s, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      The diagnostic ability of rFOV DWI sequence may be better than that of fFOV DWI 
      using VI-RADS for the differentiation between NMIBC and MIBC regardless of 
      image-reading experience, it is controversial.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Identification of muscle-invasive status (MIS) of 
      bladder cancer (BCa) is critical for treatment decisions. The Vesical 
      Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) has been widely used in 
      preoperatively predicting MIS using tri-parametric MR imaging including 
      T2-weighted (T2W), diffusion-weighted (DW), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) 
      sequences. While the diagnostic values of radiomics features from bi-parametric 
      MRI such as T2W + DW to identification of MIS have been reported, whether the 
      tri-parametric MRI could provide additional diagnostic value to the radiomics 
      prediction task, and how to integrate DCE features into the radiomics model, 
      which is the objectives of this study, remain unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Patients with postoperatively confirmed BCa lesions (150 in non-muscle-invasive 
      BCa and 56 in muscle-invasive BCa groups) were retrospectively included. Their 
      T2W, DW with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and DCE sequences were 
      acquired using a 3.0T MR system. Regions of interest were manually depicted and 
      VI-RADS scores were assessed by three radiologists. Three predictive models were 
      developed by the radiomics features extracted from sequence combinations of 
      T2W + DW (Model one), T2W + DCE (Model two), and T2W + DW + DCE (Model three), 
      respectively, using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The 
      performance of each model was quantitatively assessed on both the training 
      (n = 165) and testing (n = 41) cohorts. Then a 10 times five-fold cross 
      validation was conducted to assess the overall performance. RESULTS: Three models 
      achieved area under the curve of 0.888, 0.869, and 0.901 in the cross validation, 
      respectively. The tri-parametric model performed significantly superior than the 
      two bi-parametric models and VI-RADS. The analysis of feature coefficients 
      derived from least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm showed 
      features from the tri-parametric MRI are effective in MIS discrimination. 
      CONCLUSION: The tri-parametric MRI provides additional value to the 
      radiomics-based identification of MIS.

TI  - Myoarchitectural and functional alterations in rabbit external anal sphincter 
      muscle following experimental surgical trauma.
PG  - G445-51
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00450.2013 [doi]
AB  - Obstetrical trauma to external anal sphincter (EAS) is extremely common; however, 
      its role in the development of anal incontinence is not clear. We examined the 
      regenerative process and functional impact of experimental surgical trauma to EAS 
      muscle in an animal model. Surgical myotomy, a craniocaudal incision extending 
      along the entire length and thickness of the EAS, was performed in rabbits. 
      Animals were allowed to recover, and anal pressures were recorded at weekly 
      intervals for 12 wk using a custom-designed probe system to determine the 
      length-tension property of EAS muscle. Animals were killed at predetermined time 
      intervals, and the anal canal was harvested for histochemical studies (for 
      determination of muscle/connective tissue/collagen) and sarcomere length 
      measurement. In addition, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MR-DTI) 
      and fiber tracking was performed to determine myoarchitectural changes in the 
      EAS. Myotomy of the EAS muscle resulted in significant impairment of its 
      length-tension property that showed only partial recovery during the 12-wk study 
      period. Histology revealed marked increase in the fibrosis (connective tissue = 
      69% following myotomy vs. 28% in controls) at 3 wk, which persisted at 12 wk. 
      Immunostaining studies confirmed deposition of collagen in the fibrotic tissue. 
      There was no change in the sarcomere length following myotomy. MR-DTI studies 
      revealed disorganized muscle fiber orientation in the regenerating muscle. We 
      conclude that, following experimental injury, the EAS muscle heals with an 
      increase in the collagen content and loss of normal myoarchitecture, which we 
      suspect is the cause of impaired EAS function.

PG  - W282-90
LID - 10.2214/AJR.08.1340 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine the optimal b value for 1.5-T 
      diffusion tensor (DT) MRI and fiber tractography of in vivo human skeletal 
      muscle. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers were included in this 
      prospective study. DT MRI of the proximal calf was performed with 15 directions 
      of diffusion sensitization and parallel imaging with an acceleration factor of 2. 
      Each single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence was performed in each 
      volunteer with eight b values ranging from 125 s/mm(2) to 1,000 s/mm(2). Fiber 
      tractography of two calf muscles (anterior tibialis and lateral gastrocnemius) 
      was performed, and image quality was ranked 1-8. Fractional anisotropy, 
      signal-to-noise ratio, and fiber density index were assessed for both muscles at 
      each b value. Statistical analysis was performed with repeated measurement 
      analysis of variance. RESULTS: Among all fiber tractographic images assessed, 
      those obtained at a b value of 625 s/mm(2) were qualitatively ranked first (best 
      image quality) or second (second-best image quality). Signal-to-noise ratio was 
      highest for both muscles at a b value of 125 s/mm(2) (anterior tibialis, 66.2; 
      lateral gastrocnemius, 60.1). The highest fiber density indexes were found for 
      both muscles at a b value of 625 s/mm(2) (anterior tibialis index, 7.82; lateral 
      gastrocnemius index, 5.75). In the analysis of variance no significant 
      differences were found between fractional anisotropy and b values for either 
      muscle (p = 0.359 and p = 0.078). CONCLUSION: The optimal b value for in vivo DT 
      MRI and tractographic assessment of human skeletal muscle in the calf at 1.5 T 
      MRI was found to be 625 s/mm(2).

TI  - Triggered intravoxel incoherent motion MRI for the assessment of calf muscle 
      perfusion during isometric intermittent exercise.
PG  - e3922
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3922 [doi]
AB  - The main aim of this paper was to propose triggered intravoxel incoherent motion 
      (IVIM) imaging sequences for the evaluation of perfusion changes in calf muscles 
      before, during and after isometric intermittent exercise. Twelve healthy 
      volunteers were involved in the study. The subjects were asked to perform 
      intermittent isometric plantar flexions inside the MRI bore. MRI of the calf 
      muscles was performed on a 3.0 T scanner and diffusion-weighted (DW) images were 
      obtained using eight different b values (0 to 500 s/mm(2) ). Acquisitions were 
      performed at rest, during exercise and in the subsequent recovery phase. A 
      motion-triggered echo-planar imaging DW sequence was implemented to avoid 
      movement artifacts. Image quality was evaluated using the average edge strength 
      (AES) as a quantitative metric to assess the motion artifact effect. IVIM 
      parameters (diffusion D, perfusion fraction f and pseudo-diffusion D*) were 
      estimated using a segmented fitting approach and evaluated in gastrocnemius and 
      soleus muscles. No differences were observed in quality of IVIM images between 
      resting state and triggered exercise, whereas the non-triggered images acquired 
      during exercise had a significantly lower value of AES (reduction of more than 
      20%). The isometric intermittent plantar-flexion exercise induced an increase of 
      all IVIM parameters (D by 10%; f by 90%; D* by 124%; fD* by 260%), in agreement 
      with the increased muscle perfusion occurring during exercise. Finally, IVIM 
      parameters reverted to the resting values within 3 min during the recovery phase. 
      In conclusion, the IVIM approach, if properly adapted using motion-triggered 
      sequences, seems to be a promising method to investigate muscle perfusion during 
      isometric exercise.

TI  - [Bladder cancer local staging about muscle invasion: 3.0T MRI performance 
      following transurethral resection].
PG  - 701-704
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging 
      examination (MRI) for the local detecting of muscle invasive bladder cancer 
      following transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). METHODS: 
      Retrospective study identified 55 patients with pathology-proven bladder cancer 
      who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor followed by 3.0T magnetic 
      resonance imaging between September 2012 and April 2019 in our hospital. Two 
      radiologists reviewed pelvic magnetic resonance imaging together and judged 
      muscle invasive bladder cancer. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 
      calculated for the presence of muscle invasion by T2 weighted imaging (T2WI) 
      only, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) only and T2WI+DWI compared with the 
      findings at radical cystectomy as the reference standard. RESULTS: Of the 55 
      patients with pathological results from radical cystectomy, 3.64% (2/55) had no 
      residual disease; 29.09% (16/55) were non-muscle invasive bladder cancer on 
      pathology, including 13 cases in T1 and 3 cases in Ta; 34.55% (19/55) were in 
      stage T2 depending on pathology, 25.45% (14/55) in T3, and 7.27% (4/55) in T4. 
      The average age was 60.76 years, ranging from 42 to 82 years. There were 48 males 
      and 7 females in our study. Before pelvic MRI examination, all the patients 
      received transurethral resection of bladder tumor, including 16 cases taking the 
      operation in our hospital and 39 cases in other hospitals. The interval between 
      the pelvic MRI examination and transurethral resection of bladder tumor was more 
      than 2 weeks in all the patients. They all underwent radical cystectomy within 1 
      month after the pelvic MRI examination, and no patient underwent radiotherapy or 
      chemotherapy in our study during the interval between the MRI examination and 
      radical cystectomy. T2WI only, DWI only, and T2WI+DWI of 3.0T magnetic resonance 
      imaging for readers were with sensitivity: 94.59%, 83.78%, 91.89%; with 
      specificity: 66.67%, 77.78%, 72.22% and with accuracy: 85.45%, 81.82%, 85.45%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: 3.0T MRI may have a role in diagnosing muscle invasive 
      bladder cancer following TURBT. T2WI has the advantage of detecting the location 
      of bladder tumor, and DWI has the advantage of differentiating between the benign 
      and malignant lesion. 3.0T MRI T2WI+DWI has a good utility in the detection of 
      muscle invasive bladder cancer following TURBT with satisfied accuracy.

AB  - The aim of this study was to document upper leg involvement in spinal muscular 
      atrophy (SMA) with quantitative MRI (qMRI) in a cross-sectional cohort of 
      patients of varying type, disease severity and age. Thirty-one patients with SMA 
      types 2 and 3 (aged 29.6 [7.6-73.9] years) and 20 healthy controls (aged 37.9 
      [17.7-71.6] years) were evaluated in a 3 T MRI with a protocol consisting of 
      DIXON, T2 mapping and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). qMRI measures were compared 
      with clinical scores of motor function (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale 
      Expanded [HFMSE]) and muscle strength. Patients exhibited an increased fat 
      fraction and fractional anisotropy (FA), and decreased mean diffusivity (MD) and 
      T2 compared with controls (all P < .001). DTI parameters FA and MD manifest 
      stronger effects than can be accounted for the effect of fatty replacement. Fat 
      fraction, FA and MD show moderate correlation with muscle strength and motor 
      function: FA is negatively associated with HFMSE and Medical Research Council sum 
      score (τ = -0.56 and -0.59; both P < .001) whereas for fat fraction values are τ 
      = -0.50 and -0.58, respectively (both P < .001). This study shows that DTI 
      parameters correlate with muscle strength and motor function. DTI findings 
      indirectly indicate cell atrophy and act as a measure independently of fat 
      fraction. Combined these data suggest the potential of muscle DTI in monitoring 
      disease progression and to study SMA pathogenesis in muscle.

LID - 10.1002/mrm.26469 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the sensitivity of diffusion-MR signal to microstructural 
      change in muscle tissue associated with pathology, and recommend optimal 
      acquisition parameters. METHODS: We employ Monte-Carlo simulation of diffusing 
      spins in hierarchical tissue to generate synthetic diffusion-weighted signal 
      curves over a wide range of scan parameters. Curves are analyzed using entropy-a 
      measure of curve complexity. Entropy change between a baseline and various 
      microstructural scenarios is investigated. We find acquisitions that optimize 
      entropy difference in each scenario. RESULTS: Permeability changes have a large 
      effect on the diffusion-weighted signal curve. Muscle fiber atrophy is also 
      important, although differentiating between mechanisms is challenging. Several 
      acquisitions over a range of diffusion times is optimal for imaging 
      microstructural change in muscle tissue. Sensitivity to permeability is optimized 
      for high gradient strengths, but sensitivity to other scenarios is optimal at 
      other values. CONCLUSIONS: The diffusion-attenuated signal is sensitive to the 
      microstructural changes, but the changes are subtle. Taking full advantage of the 
      changes to the overall curve requires a set of acquisitions over a range of 
      diffusion times. Permeability causes the largest changes, but even the very 
      subtle changes associated with fiber radius distribution change the curves more 
      than noise alone. Magn Reson Med 78:1187-1198, 2017. © 2016 International Society

TI  - Dedicated MR system and acute trauma of the musculo-skeletal system.
PG  - 7-10
AB  - MRI diffusion in the osteoarticular field is limited by the high costs of 
      whole-body systems. Recent technological advances have allowed the development of 
      cost-effective and easy-to-install dedicated MRI systems. One such system, which 
      can only be employed for the study of limbs, is based on a 0.2-T permanent 
      magnet. Acute trauma of the musculo-skeletal system represents an important area 
      of application. Over a period of 2 years, 1258 patients with acute trauma of the 
      joints (64%) and the periarticular bones (36%) have been studied. Satisfactory 
      results, comparable to those from whole-body scanners operating at higher 
      magnetic fields, were obtained. Acute painful syndromes did not represent an 
      obstacle to the performance of the examination. Only in 2% of patients was it not 
      possible to carry out the examination due to oversized limbs or complete 
      articular blocks. On the basis of these considerations, it may be predicted that 
      in the near future dedicated MR systems will find increasingly wide application 
      in the field of musculo-skeletal traumatology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diffusion-weighted imaging is able to reflect histopathology 
      architecture. A novel imaging approach, namely histogram analysis, is used to 
      further characterize lesion on MRI. To correlate histogram parameters derived 
      from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps with histopathology parameters in 
      muscle lymphoma. METHODS: Eight patients (mean age 64.8 years, range 45-72 years) 
      with histopathologically confirmed muscle lymphoma were retrospectively 
      identified. Cell count, total nucleic and average nucleic areas were estimated 
      using ImageJ. Additionally, Ki67-index was calculated. Diffusion-weightedimaging 
      was obtained on a 1.5 T scanner by using the b-values of 0 and 1000 s mm(-)(2). 
      Histogram analysis was performed as a whole lesion measurement by using a 
      custom-made Matlab-based application. RESULTS: All ADC parameters showed a good 
      to excellent interreader variability. Cell count correlated well with ADCmean (ρ 
      = -0.76, p = 0.03) and ADCp75 (ρ =-0.79, p = 0.02). Kurtosis and entropy 
      correlated with average nucleic area (ρ = -0.81, p = 0.02, ρ =0.88, p = 0.007, 
      respectively). None of the analyzed ADC parameters correlated with total nucleic 
      area and with Ki67-index. CONCLUSION: ADC histogram analysis parameters can 
      reflect cellularity in muscle lymphoma. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Histogram

AB  - History A 43-year-old right-handed man presented with a history of progressive 
      mild left-sided weakness and slowness of movements. Symptoms began 4 years 
      earlier, and the patient noticed a progressive decline in his daily routine due 
      to gait difficulties in the past year. There was no history of head trauma, 
      surgery, drug therapy, smoking, or alcohol abuse, nor was there any relevant 
      family history. Examination revealed normal cognition (29 of 30 points on the 
      Mini-Mental State Examination and 27 of 30 points on the Montreal Cognitive 
      Assessment) and normal cerebellar, sensory, cranial nerve, and autonomic 
      function. There was mild left-sided weakness involving the upper and lower limbs 
      (medical research council graded muscle strength as 4+ out of 5) that was 
      associated with facial hypomimia and a rigid akinetic syndrome only in the 
      patient's left hemibody (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] part 
      III [motor examination], 23 out of 52 points). Mild atrophy in the left upper and 
      lower limbs without pain, swelling, or skin lesions was noted at physical 
      examination. Routine blood chemistry was normal, as were serum creatine kinase 
      and aldolase levels and thyroid, hepatic, and renal function. T1- and 
      T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion- and 
      perfusion-weighted, and contrast material-enhanced brain magnetic resonance (MR) 
      imaging results were normal, without basal ganglia hyperintensity, lacunae, 
      calcification, or heavy metal deposits. Muscle MR imaging and single photon 
      emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium 99m ((99m)Tc) tropane 
      dopamine transporter (TRODAT)-1 were performed for further evaluation. This 
      patient received levodopa and benserazide (200 and 50 mg, respectively) four 
      times a day and amantadine (100 mg) three times a day without adequate 
      improvement (UPDRS score decreased from 23 to 20 points).

AB  - Merosin-deficient CMD type 1A (MDC1A), caused by mutations of laminin subunit 
      alpha 2 (LAMA2), is a predominant subtype of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD). 
      Herein, we described a Chinese patient with MDC1A who was admitted to hospital 17 
      days after birth because of marasmus and feeding difficulties. Mutations were 
      identified by targeted capture and next generation sequencing (NGS) and further 
      confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Paternity was confirmed by short tandem repeat 
      analysis. Physical examination showed malnutrition, poor suck and appendicular 
      hypotonia. Her serum CK levels were 2483 and 1962 U/L at 2 and 4 months of age, 
      respectively. Brain magnetic resonance imaging performed at 1 month of age 
      presented hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, T1-weighted images in parietal 
      and occipital lobes, and diffusion-weighted image (DWI) as well as hypointensity 
      on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image; however, the cerebellum and 
      corpus arenaceum were normal. At 7 months of age, delayed developmental 
      milestones were observed, and she failed to turn her body over and raise her head 
      up. A point mutation (c.1782+2T > G) and a frameshift duplication (c.8217dupT) in 
      the LAMA2 gene were identified by targeted capture and NGS and further confirmed 
      by Sanger sequencing. Moreover, genotyping with multiple short tandem repeat 
      markers confirmed paternity to demonstrate that the point mutation is de novo. 
      The frameshift duplication (c.8217dupT), inherited from her mother, was predicted 
      to cause a substitution of Pro (P) to Ser (S) at the 2740th amino-acid residue 
      and generate a prematurely truncated protein. The in silico analysis suggests 
      that the mutation (c.1782+2T > G) may lead to aberrant splicing of LAMA2. Our 
      case further confirms the heterogeneous clinical spectrum of MDC1A and presents 
      two novel LAMA2 mutations to expand the mutation spectrum of MDC1A.

TI  - Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Dystrophic Skeletal Muscle : Comparison of Two 
      Segmentation Methods Adapted to Chemical-shift-encoded Water-fat MRI.
PG  - 231-242
LID - 10.1007/s00062-018-0667-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the influence of two different regions of interest (ROIs) on 
      diffusion tensor metrics in dystrophic thigh muscles using a custom-made (whole 
      muscle) ROI including and a selective ROI excluding areas of fatty replacement. 
      METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and chemical-shift-encoded water-fat 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thigh was conducted on a 3-Tesla system 
      in 15 cases with muscular dystrophy and controls. The ROIs were chosen according 
      to patterns of fatty replacement on co-registered axial DTI and gradient echo 
      sequence (GRE) images. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient 
      (ADC), fiber track length (FTL), and muscle fat fractions (MFF) were compared 
      between both ROI segmentations. These comparisons, muscle-specific correlation 
      coefficients, and the influence of ROI localization on tensor metrics were 
      derived based on linear mixed effects regression models. RESULTS: In the cases 
      a high correlation was observed for ADC and FA with MFF using a custom ROI. The 
      correlation was weaker but still significant with a selective ROI method. Using 
      the custom ROI, FTL correlated significantly with MFF in 3 out of 4 muscles 
      (r ≤ -0.51). A correlation was not found for the selective ROI method. 
      Interaction analysis revealed that the association of ADC and FA with MFF was not 
      significantly influenced by the ROI localization. For FTL the ROI localization 
      significantly reduced the negative association with MFF. CONCLUSION: The DTI 
      metrics and FTL of custom ROI segmentation are significantly influenced by MFF. 
      Contrary to ADC and FA, the effect of MFF on FTL is significantly reduced when 
      applying selective ROI segmentation, which could therefore be a better option for 
      MR tractography.

      present work is to describe a novel approach in the estimation of EPI based on 
      quantitative magnetic resonance molecular imaging (qMRMI) using a pig phantom 
      since post-mortem degradation of pig meat is similar to that of human muscles. On 
      a pig phantom maintained at 20° degree, using a 1.5 T MRI scanner we performed 10 
      scans (every 4 hours) monitoring apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) magnetization transfer ration (MTR), tractography and 
      susceptibility weighted changes in muscles until 36 hours after death. Cooling of 
      the phantom during the experiment was recorded. Histology was also obtained. 
      Pearson's Test was carried out for time correlation between post-mortem interval 
      and MRI data. We found a significative inverse correlation between ADC, FA, MT 
      values and PMI. Our preliminary data shows that post-mortem qMRMI is a potential 
      powerful tool in accurately determining EPI and is worth of further 
      investigation.

TI  - Muscle mass and inspired oxygen influence oxygen extraction at maximal exercise: 
      Role of mitochondrial oxygen affinity.
PG  - e13110
LID - 10.1111/apha.13110 [doi]
AB  - AIM: We examined the Fick components together with mitochondrial O(2) affinity 
      (p50(mito) ) in defining O(2) extraction and O(2) uptake during exercise with 
      large and small muscle mass during normoxia (NORM) and hyperoxia (HYPER). 
      METHODS: Seven individuals performed 2 incremental exercise tests to exhaustion 
      on a bicycle ergometer (BIKE) and 2 on a 1-legged knee extension ergometer (KE) 
      in NORM or HYPER. Leg blood flow and VO(2) were determined by thermodilution and 
      the Fick method. Maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (OXPHOS) and 
      p50(mito) were measured ex vivo in isolated mitochondria. Mitochondrial excess 
      capacity in the leg was determined from OXPHOS in permeabilized fibres and muscle 
      mass measured with magnetic resonance imaging in relation to peak leg O(2) 
      delivery. RESULTS: The ex vivo p50(mito) increased from 0.06 ± 0.02 to 
      0.17 ± 0.04 kPa with varying substrate supply and O(2) flux rates from 
      9.84 ± 2.91 to 16.34 ± 4.07 pmol O(2) ·s(-1) ·μg(-1) respectively. O(2) 
      extraction decreased from 83% in BIKE to 67% in KE as a function of a higher O(2) 
      delivery and lower mitochondrial excess capacity. There was a significant 
      relationship between O(2) extraction and mitochondrial excess capacity and 
      p50(mito) that was unrelated to blood flow and mean transit time. CONCLUSION: 
      O(2) extraction varies with mitochondrial respiration rate, p50(mito) and O(2) 
      delivery. Mitochondrial excess capacity maintains a low p50(mito) which enhances 
      O(2) diffusion from microvessels to mitochondria during exercise.

TI  - In vivo measurement of membrane permeability and myofiber size in human muscle 
      using time-dependent diffusion tensor imaging and the random permeable barrier 
      model.
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3612 [doi]
AB  - The time dependence of the diffusion coefficient is a hallmark of tissue 
      complexity at the micrometer level. Here we demonstrate how biophysical modeling, 
      combined with a specifically tailored diffusion MRI acquisition performing 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for varying diffusion times, can be used to 
      determine fiber size and membrane permeability of muscle fibers in vivo. We 
      describe the random permeable barrier model (RPBM) and its assumptions, as well 
      as the details of stimulated echo DTI acquisition, signal processing steps, and 
      potential pitfalls. We illustrate the RPBM method on a few pilot examples 
      involving human subjects (previously published as well as new), such as revealing 
      myofiber size derived from RPBM increase after training in a calf muscle, and 
      size decrease with atrophy in shoulder rotator cuff muscle. Finally, we comment 
      on the potential clinical relevance of our results. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &

TI  - Cellular and Morphological Alterations in the Vastus Lateralis Muscle as the 
      Result of ACL Injury and Reconstruction.
PG  - 1541-7
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.16.00035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals who have had an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear and 
      reconstruction continue to experience substantial knee extensor strength loss 
      despite months of physical therapy. Identification of the alterations in muscle 
      morphology and cellular composition are needed to understand potential mechanisms 
      of muscle strength loss, initially as the result of the injury and subsequently 
      from surgery and rehabilitation. METHODS: We performed diffusion tensor 
      imaging-magnetic resonance imaging and analyzed muscle biopsies from the vastus 
      lateralis of both the affected and unaffected limbs before surgery and again from 
      the reconstructed limb following the completion of rehabilitation. 
      Immunohistochemistry was done to determine fiber type and size, Pax-7-positive 
      (satellite) cells, and extracellular matrix (via wheat germ agglutinin 
      straining). Using the diffusion tensor imaging data, the fiber tract length, 
      pennation angle, and muscle volume were determined, yielding the physiological 
      cross-sectional area (PCSA). Paired t tests were used to compare the effects of 
      the injury between injured and uninjured limbs and the effects of surgery and 
      rehabilitation within the injured limb. RESULTS: We found significant reductions 
      before surgery in type-IIA muscle cross-sectional area (CSA; p = 0.03), 
      extracellular matrix (p < 0.01), satellite cells per fiber (p < 0.01), pennation 
      angle (p = 0.03), muscle volume (p = 0.02), and PCSA (p = 0.03) in the injured 
      limb compared with the uninjured limb. Following surgery, these alterations in 
      the injured limb persisted and the frequency of the IIA fiber type decreased 
      significantly (p < 0.01) and that of the IIA/X hybrid fiber type increased 
      significantly (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Significant and prolonged differences in 
      muscle quality and morphology occurred after ACL injury and persisted despite 
      reconstruction and extensive physical therapy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results 
      suggest the need to develop more effective early interventions following an ACL 
      tear to prevent deleterious alterations within the quadriceps.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although important for dosing and dilution, there are few data 
      describing botulinum toxin (BT) movement in human muscle. OBJECTIVE: To better 
      understand BT movement within human muscle. DESIGN: Proof-of-concept study with 
      descriptive case series. SETTING: Outpatient academic practice. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Five subjects with stroke who were BT naive with a mean age of 60.4 ± 14 years 
      and time poststroke of 4.6 ± 3.7 years. METHODS: Three standardized injections 
      were given to the lateral gastrocnemius muscle (LGM): 2 contained 25 units (U) of 
      onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) in 0.25 mL of saline solution and the third 0.25 mL of 
      saline solution only. The tibialis anterior muscle (TAM) was not injected in any 
      subject. A leg magnetic resonance image was obtained at baseline, 2 months, and 3 
      months later with a 3.0 Tesla Siemens scanner. Three muscles, the LGM, lateral 
      soleus muscle (LSM), and TAM, were manually outlined on the T2 mapping sequence 
      at each time point. A histogram of T2 relaxation times (T2-RT) for all voxels at 
      baseline was used to calculate a mean and standard deviation (SD) T2-RT for each 
      muscle. Botulinum toxin muscle effect (BTME) at 2 months and 3 months was defined 
      as a subject- and muscle-specific T2-RT voxel threshold ≥3 SD above the baseline 
      mean at or near BT injection sites. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BTME volume for each 
      leg magnetic resonance imaging slice at 3 time points and 3 muscles for all 
      subjects. RESULTS: One subject missed the 3-month scan, leaving 18 potential 
      observations of BTME. Little to no BTME effect was seen in the noninjected TAM. A 
      BTME was detected in the LGM in 13 of 18 possible observations, and no effect was 
      detected in 5 observations. Possible BTME effect was seen in the LSM in 3 
      subjects due to either diffusion through fascia or needle misplacement. Volume of 
      BTME, as defined here, appeared to be substantially greater than the 0.25-mL 
      injection volume. CONCLUSIONS: This descriptive case series is among the first 
      attempts to quantify BTME within human muscle. Our findings are preliminary and 
      are limited by a few inconsistencies. However, we conclude that use of magnetic 
      resonance imaging to detect the volume of BTME is feasible and may assist 
      researchers in modeling the spread and diffusion of BT within human muscle. LEVEL 
      OF EVIDENCE: IV.

TI  - Combining DWI radiomics features with transurethral resection promotes the 
      differentiation between muscle-invasive bladder cancer and non-muscle-invasive 
      bladder cancer.
PG  - 1804-1812
LID - 10.1007/s00330-019-06484-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the value of radiomics features from diffusion-weighted 
      imaging (DWI) in differentiating muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) from 
      non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). METHODS: This retrospective study 
      included 218 pathologically confirmed bladder cancer patients (training set: 131 
      patients, 86 MIBC; validation set: 87 patients, 55 MIBC) who underwent DWI before 
      biopsy through transurethral resection (TUR) between July 2014 and December 2018. 
      Radiomics models based on DWI for discriminating state of muscle-invasive were 
      built using random forest (RF) and all-relevant (AR) methods on the training set 
      and were tested on validation set. Combination models based on TUR data were also 
      built. Discrimination performances were evaluated with the area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, 
      specificity, and F1 and F2 scores. Qualitative MRI evaluation based on morphology 
      was performed for comparison. RESULTS: No significant difference was found 
      between RF and AR models. RF model was more sensitive than TUR (0.873 vs 0.655, p 
      = 0.019) for discriminating muscle-invasive bladder cancer. When combining RF 
      with TUR, the sensitivity increased to 0.964, significantly higher than TUR 
      (0.655, p < 0.001), MRI evaluation (0.764, p = 0.006), and the combination of TUR 
      and MRI (0.836, p = 0.046). Combining RF and TUR achieved the highest accuracy of 
      0.897 and F2 score of 0.946. CONCLUSION: Combining DWI radiomics features with 
      TUR could improve the sensitivity and accuracy in discriminating the presence of 
      muscle invasion in bladder cancer for clinical practice. Multicenter, prospective 
      studies are needed to confirm our results. KEY POINTS: • Twenty-seven to 51% of 
      superficial bladder cancers diagnosed by transurethral resection are upstaged to 
      muscle-invasive at radical cystectomy, suggesting its poor sensitivity for 
      discriminating muscle-invasive bladder cancer. • A small subset of selected 
      all-relevant radiomics features exhibited an equivalent performance compared to 
      that of all the extracted features, confirming that radiomics data contained 
      redundant or irrelevant features and that feature selection should be performed 
      in building radiomics models. • Combining DWI radiomics features with 
      transurethral resection could improve in clinical practice the sensitivity and 
      accuracy for the detection of muscle invasion in bladder cancer.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the technique of choice in the diagnosis, 
      staging, and follow-up of musculoskeletal tumors. Diffusion imaging is a new 
      functional MRI technique that provides information that is complementary to that 
      obtained in conventional MRI sequences. Diffusion imaging has proven useful in 
      different clinical situations like the characterization of disease involving the 
      bone marrow (bone metastases, benign fractures, or hematological disease), the 
      evaluation of tumors of the bones and soft tissues, and the monitoring of the 
      response to treatment in patients with tumors. The aim of this article is to 
      review the diffusion technique in MRI and its current clinical applications in 
      the management of musculoskeletal tumors.

AB  - The study of muscle coordination requires knowledge of the force produced by 
      individual muscles, which can be estimated using Hill-type models. Predicted 
      forces from Hill-type models are sensitive to the muscle's maximal 
      force-generating capacity (F(max)), however, to our knowledge, no study has 
      investigated the effect of different F(max) personalization methods on predicted 
      muscle forces. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of two 
      personalization methods on predicted force-sharing strategies between the human 
      gastrocnemii during walking. Twelve participants performed a walking protocol 
      where we estimated muscle activation using surface electromyography and fascicle 
      length, velocity, and pennation angle using B-mode ultrasound to inform the 
      Hill-type model. F(max) was determined using either a scaling method or 
      experimental method. The scaling method used anthropometric scaling to determine 
      both muscle volume and fiber length, which were used to estimate the F(max) of 
      the gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis. The experimental method used muscle 
      volume and fascicle length obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion 
      tensor imaging, respectively. We found that the scaling and the experimental 
      method predicted similar gastrocnemii force-sharing strategies at the group level 
      (mean over the participants). However, substantial differences between methods in 
      predicted force-sharing strategies was apparent for some participants revealing 
      the limited ability of the scaling method to predict force-sharing strategies at 
      the level of individual participants. Further personalization of muscle models 
      using in vivo experimental data from imaging techniques is therefore likely 
      important when using force predictions to inform the diagnosis and management of 
      neurological and orthopedic conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Muscle lymphoma (ML) is a relatively uncommon condition. On magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI), ML can manifest with a broad spectrum of radiological 
      features. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the features of DW images of 
      muscle lymphoma (ML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our database, ten patients (six 
      women and four men) with ML were identified who were investigated by magnetic 
      resonance imaging including acquisition of DW images. DW images were obtained 
      using a multi-shot SE-EPI pulse sequence. Apparent diffusion constant (ADC) maps 
      were also calculated. Furthermore, fusion images were generated manually from DW 
      and HASTE or T2W images. RESULTS: On T2W images, all recognized lesions were 
      hyperintense in comparison to unaffected musculature and on T1W images they were 
      homogeneously hypointense. All lesions demonstrated low signal intensity on ADC 
      images. The calculated ADC values ranged from 0.60 to 0.90 mm(2)s(-1) (mean value 
      0.76 ± 0.10; median value 0.78). On fusion images, all lesions showed high signal 
      intensity. CONCLUSIONS: ML demonstrated low ADC values and high signal intensity 
      on fusion images suggesting high cellularity of the lesions.

      size. This latter phenomenon has been observed by computing muscle volumes from 
      conventional MRI, with most studies reporting significantly reduced volumes in 
      leg muscles. This indicates impaired muscle growth, but without knowing muscle 
      fiber orientation, it is not clear whether muscle growth in CP is impaired in the 
      along-fiber direction (indicating shortened muscles and limited range of motion) 
      or the cross-fiber direction (indicating weak muscles and impaired strength). 
      Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) we can determine muscle fiber orientation 
      and construct 3D muscle architectures which can be used to examine both 
      along-fiber length and cross-sectional area. Such an approach has not been 
      undertaken in CP. Here, we use advanced DTI sequences with fast imaging times to 
      capture fiber orientations in the soleus muscle of children with CP and 
      age-matched, able-bodied controls. Cross sectional areas perpendicular to the 
      muscle fiber direction were reduced (37 ± 11%) in children with CP compared to 
      controls, indicating impaired muscle strength. Along-fiber muscle lengths were 
      not different between groups. This study is the first to demonstrate along-fiber 
      and cross-fiber muscle architecture in CP using DTI and implicates impaired 
      cross-sectional muscle growth in children with cerebral palsy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify the changes, using magnetic 
      resonance (MR) images, in the masseter muscles caused by low-level static 
      contraction. STUDY DESIGN: Ten healthy male volunteers were enrolled in the 
      study. The MR scans were performed before, immediately after, and 10 minutes 
      after low-level static contraction. Two imaging sequences were acquired: a 
      diffusion-weighted image and an iterative decomposition of water and fat with 
      echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation (IDEAL) image. The apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the thicknesses of the 
      right and left masseter muscles were examined. RESULTS: The ADC and SNR 
      immediately after exercise were significantly higher than those before exercise 
      and 10 minutes after exercise. The muscles were significantly thicker immediately 
      after exercise than before exercise and 10 minutes after exercise. CONCLUSION: We 
      confirmed the presence of edema in the masseter muscles caused by low-level 
      static contraction using MR images.

TI  - Comparison of twice refocused spin echo versus stimulated echo diffusion tensor 
      imaging for tracking muscle fibers.
PG  - 624-32
LID - 10.1002/jmri.24585 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the precision of measuring the pennation angle and fiber 
      length in the vastus lateralis (VL) using two distinctly different diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) sequences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We imaged the thigh of 10 
      normal subjects on a 3T magnetic resonance (MR) imager with twice refocused spin 
      echo (TRSE) and stimulated echo (STEAM) DTI-MRI techniques. Both techniques took 
      the same total acquisition time and employed the same diffusion weighting and 
      gradient directions. Using the diffusion tensor images produced by each sequence, 
      muscle fiber bundles were tracked from the aponeurosis by following the first 
      eigenvector of the diffusion tensor. From these tracks we calculated the 
      pennation angle and fiber length. RESULTS: The STEAM acquisition resulted in 
      significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), lower apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC), higher fractional anisotropy (FA) values, and longer fibers 
      than TRSE. Although no difference in the pennation angle between the two 
      acquisitions was found, the TRSE sequence had a significantly greater 
      within-subject dispersion in the pennation angle of tracked fibers, which may 
      indicate a reduction in the coherence of fiber bundles. CONCLUSION: DTI of muscle 
      using a STEAM acquisition resulted in significant improvements in the SNR and FA, 
      resulting in tracking a larger number of muscle fiber bundles over longer 
      distances and with less within-subject dispersion.

TI  - An evaluation of morphological and functional multi-parametric MRI sequences in 
      classifying non-muscle and muscle invasive bladder cancer.
PG  - 3759-3766
LID - 10.1007/s00330-017-4758-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to determine the ability of multi-parametric magnetic 
      resonance imaging (mpMRI) to differentiate muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) 
      from non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). METHODS: Patients underwent 
      mpMRI before tumour resection. Four MRI sets, i.e. T2-weighted 
      (T2W) + perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), T2W plus diffusion-weighted imaging 
      (DWI), T2W + DWI + PWI, and T2W + DWI + PWI + dif-fusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      were interpreted qualitatively by two radiologists, blinded to histology results. 
      PWI, DWI and DTI were also analysed quantitatively. Accuracy was determined using 
      histopathology as the reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 82 tumours were 
      analysed. Ninety-six percent of T1-labeled tumours by the T2W + DWI + PWI image 
      set were confirmed to be NMIBC at histopathology. Overall accuracy of the 
      complete mpMRI protocol was 94% in differentiating NMIBC from MIBC. PWI, DWI and 
      DTI quantitative parameters were shown to be significantly different in cancerous 
      versus non-cancerous areas within the bladder wall in T2-labelled lesions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MpMRI with DWI and DTI appears a reliable staging tool for bladder 
      cancer. If our data are validated, then mpMRI could precede cystoscopic resection 
      to allow a faster recognition of MIBC and accelerated treatment pathways. KEY 
      POINTS: • A critical step in BCa staging is to differentiate NMIBC from MIBC. • 
      Morphological and functional sequences are reliable techniques in differentiating 
      NMIBC from MIBC. • Diffusion tensor imaging could be an additional tool in BCa 
      staging.

TI  - Characteristics of diffusion-weighted stimulated echo pulse sequence in human 
      skeletal muscle.
PG  - 92-7
LID - 10.1007/s12194-012-0174-1 [doi]
AB  - The aim of our study was to simulate an effective diffusion-weighted imaging 
      (DWI) pulse sequence and to evaluate the best b value in skeletal muscle. The 
      evaluated pulse sequences were spin echo (SE), stimulated echo (STE), and 
      gradient-recalled echo (GRE). The signal intensity changed in some DWI pulse 
      sequences when the b value was changed. Moreover, the static magnetic field of 
      1.5 T was compared with that of 3.0 T. Next, diffusion tensor imaging of the 
      human skeletal muscle was measured. The experimental subjects were healthy male 
      volunteers (n = 7; age 21.8 ± 1.1 years). We changed the b value in steps of 100 
      s/mm(2) from 0 to 2000 s/mm(2), and the diffusion values [fractional anisotropy 
      (FA), λ(1), λ(2), and λ(3)] were calculated based on the data. The STE method 
      could maintain signals up to b values of 1300 s/mm(2), but the SE and GRE methods 
      suffered from high noise. In the human study, the mean FA (±SD) was 0.41 ± 0.02 
      in the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) and 0.31 ± 0.02 in the soleus muscle (SOL) 
      at a b value of 1000 s/mm(2). The correlation of the FA with the b value 
      coefficient and the P value by Student's t test were r = 0.981 and P < 0.001 for 
      the TA and r = 0.982, P < 0.001 for the SOL. However, the FA became high with a 
      low b value. In conclusion, STE was very useful for DWI in a short T (2)-value 
      tissue. Moreover, a minimum b value of 800 s/mm(2) was necessary for evaluation 
      of human skeletal muscle.

      and diffusion-weighted imaging and mimicked an acute-phase hematoma. However, it 
      showed no chronological changes typical of a hematoma, and MRI revealed 
      enlargement of the mass 1 week after admission. Histopathological examination of 
      a biopsy specimen revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Although 
      skeletal muscle lymphoma is rare, physicians should be familiar with its MRI 
      characteristics. In addition, determination of the lymphoma subtype has important 
      implications for the treatment of skeletal muscle lymphoma because DLCBL may have 
      an especially poor prognosis.

TI  - Quantitative muscle magnetic resonance imaging depicts microstructural 
      abnormalities but no signs of inflammation or dystrophy in post-COVID-19 
      condition.
PG  - 970-981

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) has high impact on quality 
      of life, with myalgia and fatigue affecting at least 25% of PCC patients. This 
      case-control study aims to noninvasively assess muscular alterations via 
      quantitative muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as possible mechanisms for 
      ongoing musculoskeletal complaints and premature exhaustion in PCC. METHODS: 
      Quantitative muscle MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner of the whole legs 
      in PCC patients compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, including a 
      Dixon sequence to determine muscle fat fraction (FF), a multi-echo spin-echo 
      sequence for quantitative water mapping reflecting putative edema, and a 
      diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence to assess 
      microstructural alterations. Clinical examination, nerve conduction studies, and 
      serum creatine kinase were performed in all patients. Quantitative muscle MRI 
      results were correlated to the results of the 6-min walk test and standardized 
      questionnaires assessing quality of life, fatigue, and depression. RESULTS: 
      Twenty PCC patients (female: n = 15, age = 48.8 ± 10.1 years, symptoms 
      duration = 13.4 ± 4.2 months, body mass index [BMI] = 28.8 ± 4.7 kg/m(2) ) were 
      compared to 20 healthy controls (female: n = 15, age = 48.1 ± 11.1 years, 
      BMI = 22.9 ± 2.2 kg/m(2) ). Neither FF nor T2 revealed signs of muscle 
      degeneration or inflammation in either study groups. Diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) revealed reduced mean, axial, and radial diffusivity in the PCC group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative muscle MRI did not depict any signs of ongoing 
      inflammation or dystrophic process in the skeletal muscles in PCC patients. 
      However, differences observed in muscle DTI depict microstructural abnormalities, 
      which may reflect potentially reversible fiber hypotrophy due to deconditioning. 
      Further longitudinal and interventional studies should prove this hypothesis.

TI  - Risk factors for worsened muscle strength after the surgical treatment of 
      arteriovenous malformations of the eloquent motor area.
PG  - 289-98
LID - 10.3171/2015.6.JNS15969 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT Case selection for the surgical treatment of arteriovenous malformations 
      (AVMs) of the eloquent motor area remains challenging. The aim of this study was 
      to determine the risk factors for worsened muscle strength after surgery in 
      patients with this disorder. METHODS At their hospital the authors 
      retrospectively studied 48 consecutive patients with AVMs involving motor cortex 
      and/or the descending pathway. All patients had undergone preoperative functional 
      MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), followed by resection. Both 
      functional and angioarchitectural factors were analyzed with respect to the 
      change in muscle strength. Functional factors included lesion-to-corticospinal 
      tract distance (LCD) on DTI and lesion-to-activation area distance (LAD) and 
      cortical reorganization on fMRI. Based on preoperative muscle strength, the 
      changes in muscle strength at 1 week and 6 months after surgery were defined as 
      short-term and long-term surgical outcomes, respectively. Statistical analysis 
      was performed using the statistical package SPSS (version 20.0.0, IBM Corp.). 
      RESULTS Twenty-one patients (43.8%) had worsened muscle strength 1 week after 
      surgery. However, only 10 patients (20.8%) suffered from muscle strength 
      worsening 6 months after surgery. The LCD was significantly correlated with 
      short-term (p < 0.001) and long-term (p < 0.001) surgical outcomes. For long-term 
      outcomes, patients in the 5 mm ≥ LCD > 0 mm (p = 0.009) and LCD > 5 mm (p < 
      0.001) categories were significantly associated with a lower risk of permanent 
      motor worsening in comparison with patients in the LCD = 0 mm group. No 
      significant difference was found between patients in the 5 mm ≥ LCD > 0 mm group 
      and LCD > 5 mm group (p = 0.116). Nidus size was the other significant predictor 
      of short-term (p = 0.021) and long-term (p = 0.016) outcomes. For long-term 
      outcomes, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.728, and the cutoff point was 
      3.6 cm. Spetzler-Martin grade was not associated with short-term surgical 
      outcomes (0.143), although it was correlated with long-term outcomes (0.038). 
      CONCLUSIONS An AVM with a nidus in contact with tracked eloquent fibers (LCD = 0) 
      and having a large size is more likely to be associated with worsened muscle 
      strength after surgery in patients with eloquent motor area AVMs. Surgical 
      treatment in these patients should be carefully considered. In patients with an 
      LCD > 5 mm, radical resection may be considered to eliminate the risk of 
      hemorrhage.

TI  - The repeatability of bilateral diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the upper leg 
      muscles of healthy adults.
PG  - 1709-1718
LID - 10.1007/s00330-019-06403-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Assessment of the repeatability of diffusion parameter estimations in 
      the upper leg muscles of healthy adults over the time course of 2 weeks, from a 
      simultaneous bilateral upper leg DTI measurement. METHODS: SE-EPI DTI datasets 
      were acquired at 3 T in the upper legs of 15 active adults at a time interval of 
      2 weeks. ROIs were manually drawn for four quadriceps and three hamstring muscles 
      of both legs. The following DTI parameters were analyzed: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd 
      eigenvalue (λ(1), λ(2), and λ(3)), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional 
      anisotropy (FA). DTI parameters per muscle were calculated with and without 
      intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) correction together with SNR levels per 
      muscle. Bland-Altman plots and within-subject coefficient of variation (wsCV) 
      were calculated. Left-right differences between muscles were assessed. RESULTS: 
      The Bland-Altman analysis showed good repeatability of all DTI parameters except 
      FA for both the IVIM-corrected and standard data. wsCV values show that MD has 
      the highest repeatability (4.5% IVIM; 5.6% standard), followed by λ(2) (4.9% 
      IVIM; 5.5% standard), λ(1) (5.3% IVIM; 7.5% standard), and λ(3) (5.7% IVIM; 5.7% 
      standard). wsCV values of FA were 15.2% for the IVIM-corrected data and 13.9% for 
      the standard analysis. The SNR (41.8 ± 16.0 right leg, 41.7 ± 17.1 left leg) and 
      wsCV values were similar for the left and right leg and no left-right bias was 
      detected. CONCLUSIONS: Repeatability was good for standard DTI data and slightly 
      better for IVIM-corrected DTI data. Our protocol is suitable for DTI of the upper 
      legs with overall good SNR. KEY POINTS: • The presented DTI protocol is 
      repeatable and therefore suitable for bilateral DT imaging of the upper legs. • 
      Additional B1(+)calibrations improve SNR and repeatability. • Correcting for 
      perfusion effects improves repeatability.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of masticatory muscle changes by Eichner index using 
      diffusion-weighted imaging.
PG  - 437-445
LID - 10.1007/s11282-022-00656-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides quantitative functional 
      information about the microscopic movement of water at the cellular level. 
      However, few reports have quantitatively evaluated histological changes in 
      masticatory muscles due to changes in occlusal relationships using DWI. This 
      study aimed to assess the changes in masticatory muscles by Eichner index using 
      DWI. METHODS: We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of 201 
      patients from November 2017 to April 2018. Each Eichner index group, age, and sex 
      were used as criterion variables, and the average apparent diffusion coefficient 
      (ADC) values of the masticatory muscles were the explanatory variable. The mean 
      ADC value differences were analyzed in each Eichner index group. We analyzed the 
      data using the Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni 
      adjustment multiple regression analysis with Shapiro-Wilk test and Spearman's 
      correlation coefficients. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
      RESULTS: The mean ADC values of each Eichner classification group were 
      significantly different, with the lowest value in group C (P < 0.001). There was 
      a negative correlation between the ADC value of the masseter, lateral pterygoid 
      muscle, and age (P < 0.001). There were significant differences between the sex 
      groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ADC values of masticatory muscles were 
      significantly different in the Eichner index groups. The ADC values of 
      masticatory muscles may be useful for the quantitative evaluation of the 
      masticatory muscles affected by the occlusal state.

AB  - Coupled with diffusion tractography, non-rigid registration of high-resolution 
      anatomical MR images allows the calculation of local strains along human skeletal 
      muscle fascicles in-vivo. A reference study (passively imposed lengthening of 
      gastrocnemius medial muscle) reported local shortening and lengthening occurring 
      along the same muscle fascicles. However, the robustness of strain amplitudes and 
      distribution patterns should be studied, as the heterogeneity of local length 
      changes has major implications for muscle function. Using a previous image set of 
      human medial gastrocnemius (GM) we aimed at testing: (1) the consistency of our 
      MRI-DTI analysis workflow against changes made to the software environments, (2) 
      the hypothesis that non-rigid demons algorithm tuning parameters (16 paired 
      combinations were tested) are not a significant determinant of muscle fiber 
      direction strain heterogeneity caused by passive knee extension. A profoundly 
      altered analysis workflow did reproduce the original results well, showing a 
      general pattern of proximally lengthened and distally shortened muscle fascicles 
      (strain amplitude range: 21%-67%). Hierarchical shift function analyses and 
      pairwise comparison of strain distributions between 10 equal parts of the tracked 
      GM fascicles confirmed the hypothesis showing no significant effects of tuning 
      parameters determining the in-vivo deformation field inhomogeneity. The findings 
      show the robustness of the MRI-DTI method, and confirming the hypothesis, also 
      the consistency of along muscle fascicle strain heterogeneity patterns against 
      parameter selection. However, the strain amplitudes do vary with parameter 
      choices. New studies are indicated to determine optimal tuning parameters to 
      achieve accurate strain amplitudes compared to exact strains.

TI  - Three-dimensional architecture of the whole human soleus muscle in vivo.
PG  - e4610
LID - 10.7717/peerj.4610 [doi]
LID - e4610
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most data on the architecture of the human soleus muscle have been 
      obtained from cadaveric dissection or two-dimensional ultrasound imaging. We 
      present the first comprehensive, quantitative study on the three-dimensional 
      anatomy of the human soleus muscle in vivo using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      techniques. METHODS: We report three-dimensional fascicle lengths, pennation 
      angles, fascicle curvatures, physiological cross-sectional areas and volumes in 
      four compartments of the soleus at ankle joint angles of 69 ± 12° 
      (plantarflexion, short muscle length; average ± SD across subjects) and 108 ± 7° 
      (dorsiflexion, long muscle length) of six healthy young adults. Microdissection 
      and three-dimensional digitisation on two cadaveric muscles corroborated the 
      compartmentalised structure of the soleus, and confirmed the validity of 
      DTI-based muscle fascicle reconstructions. RESULTS: The posterior compartments of 
      the soleus comprised 80 ± 5% of the total muscle volume (356 ± 58 cm(3)). At the 
      short muscle length, the average fascicle length, pennation angle and curvature 
      was 37 ± 8 mm, 31 ± 3° and 17 ± 4 /m, respectively. We did not find differences 
      in fascicle lengths between compartments. However, pennation angles were on 
      average 12° larger (p < 0.01) in the posterior compartments than in the anterior 
      compartments. For every centimetre that the muscle-tendon unit lengthened, 
      fascicle lengths increased by 3.7 ± 0.8 mm, pennation angles decreased by -3.2 
      ± 0.9° and curvatures decreased by -2.7 ± 0.8 /m. Fascicles in the posterior 
      compartments rotated almost twice as much as in the anterior compartments during 
      passive lengthening. DISCUSSION: The homogeneity in fascicle lengths and 
      inhomogeneity in pennation angles of the soleus may indicate a functionally 
      different role for the anterior and posterior compartments. The data and 
      techniques presented here demonstrate how DTI can be used to obtain detailed, 
      quantitative measurements of the anatomy of complex skeletal muscles in living 
      humans.

TI  - Determining Subject-Specific Lower-Limb Muscle Architecture Data for 
      Musculoskeletal Models Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging.
LID - 060905 [pii]
LID - 10.1115/1.4040946 [doi]
AB  - Accurate individualized muscle architecture data are crucial for generating 
      subject-specific musculoskeletal models to investigate movement and dynamic 
      muscle function. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 
      has emerged as a promising method of gathering muscle architecture data in vivo; 
      however, its accuracy in estimating parameters such as muscle fiber lengths for 
      creating subject-specific musculoskeletal models has not been tested. Here, we 
      provide a validation of the method of using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) and DTI to gather muscle architecture data in vivo by directly comparing 
      those data obtained from MR scans of three human cadaveric lower limbs to those 
      from dissections. DTI was used to measure fiber lengths and pennation angles, 
      while the anatomical images were used to estimate muscle mass, which were used to 
      calculate physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). The same data were then 
      obtained through dissections, where it was found that on average muscle masses 
      and fiber lengths matched well between the two methods (4% and 1% differences, 
      respectively), while PCSA values had slightly larger differences (6%). Overall, 
      these results suggest that DTI is a promising technique to gather in vivo muscle 
      architecture data, but further refinement and complementary imaging techniques 
      may be needed to realize these goals.

TI  - Apparent diffusion coefficients of 31P metabolites in the human calf muscle at 
      7 T.
LID - 10.1007/s10334-023-01065-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In this study, we aimed to measure the apparent diffusion coefficients 
      (ADCs) of major phosphorous metabolites in the human calf muscle at 7 T with a 
      diffusion-weighted (DW)-STEAM sequence. METHODS: A DW-STEAM sequence with bipolar 
      gradients was implemented at 7 T, and DW MR spectra were acquired in three 
      orthogonal directions in the human calf muscle of six healthy volunteers 
      (TE/TM/TR = 15 ms/750 ms/5 s) at three b-values (0, 800, and 1200 s/mm(2)). 
      Frequency and phase alignments were applied prior to spectral averaging. Averaged 
      DW MR spectra were analyzed with LCModel, and ADCs of (31)P metabolites were 
      estimated. RESULTS: Four metabolites (phosphocreatine (PCr), adenosine 
      triphosphate (ATP), inorganic phosphate (Pi) and glycerol phosphorylcholine 
      (GPC)) were quantified at all b-values with mean CRLBs below 10%. The ADC values 
      of PCr, ATP, Pi, and GPC were (0.24 ± 0.02, 0.15 ± 0.04, 0.43 ± 0.14, 
      0.40 ± 0.09) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively. CONCLUSION: The ADCs of four (31)P 
      metabolites were successfully measured in the human calf muscle at 7 T, among 
      which those of ATP, Pi and GPC were reported for the first time in humans. This 
      study paves the way to investigate (31)P metabolite diffusion properties in 
      health and disease on the clinical MR scanner.

TI  - In ovo monitoring of smooth muscle fiber development in the chick embryo: 
      diffusion tensor imaging with histologic correlation.
PG  - e34009
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0034009 [doi]
LID - e34009
AB  - BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive method of evaluating 
      embryonic development. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, which is 
      based on the measuring the directional diffusivity of water molecules, is an 
      established method of evaluating tissue structure. Prolonged imaging times have 
      precluded the use of embryonic diffusion tensor imaging due to motion artifact. 
      Using temperature-based motion suppression, we aimed to investigate whether 
      diffusion tensor imaging can be used to monitor embryonic smooth muscle 
      development in ovo, and to determine the correlation between 
      histologically-derived muscle fiber fraction, day of incubation and diffusion 
      tensor imaging fractional anisotropy values and length of tracked fibers. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From a set of 82 normally developing fertile 
      chicken eggs, 5 eggs were randomly chosen each day from incubation days 5 to 18 
      and cooled using a dual-cooling technique prior to and during magnetic resonance 
      imaging at 3.0 Tesla. Smooth muscle fibers of the gizzard were tracked using 
      region of interests placed over the gizzard. Following imaging, the egg was 
      cracked and the embryo was fixated and sectioned, and a micrograph most closely 
      corresponding to the acquired magnetic resonance image was made. Smooth muscle 
      fiber fraction was determined using an automated computer algorithm. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We show that diffusion tensor images of smooth muscle 
      within the embryonic gizzard can be acquired in ovo from incubation day 11 
      through hatching. Length of tracked fibers and day of incubation were found to 
      have statistical significance (p<0.05) by multiple linear regression correlation 
      with histologic specimens of sacrificed embryos from day 11 of incubation through 
      hatching. The morphologic pattern of development in our histologic specimens 
      corresponds to the development of embryonic gizzard as reported in the 
      literature. These results suggest that diffusion tensor imaging can provide a 
      noninvasive method of evaluating in ovo development of smooth muscle tissue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance training is recommended for preventing sarcopenia, but the 
      benefits for the quality and quantity of muscle mass are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To 
      assess the effects of high-intensity resistance training (HIRT) on clinical and 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters in women with sarcopenia. METHODS: A 
      researcher-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted. Community-dwelling 
      older women with sarcopenia were randomized to six months of HIRT or a control 
      group (CG). Body composition was assessed with bioimpedance equipment, and 
      participants underwent strength and functional performance tests (short physical 
      performance battery [SPPB] and gait speed). MRI scans of the thigh were taken to 
      quantify muscle mass and quality. RESULTS: Thirty-eight women completed the study 
      (20 in the HIRT group). Sarcopenia remitted in 50 % of the HIRT group. HIRT 
      elicited a significant group × time interaction effect for muscle mass 
      (p = 0.027; Ƞ(2) = 0.129), muscle mass index (p = 0.023; Ƞ(2) = 0.135), fat mass 
      (p = 0.048; Ƞ(2) = 0.103) and all strength variables (p < 0.05; Ƞ(2) > 0.120). 
      Moreover, the HIRT group obtained higher scores on the SPPB (mean difference [MD] 
      1.2; p = 0.005) and the 5 times sit-to-stand test (MD = 0.7; p = 0.009). 
      Regarding MRI parameters, infiltrated microscopic fat decreased significantly 
      (HIRT: MD = -0.01; p < 0.05), while hydration (T2) decreased in the CG 
      (MD = 3.6 ms; p = 0.053) at six months. There were significant between-group 
      differences at six months for water diffusion (HIRT: 1.09 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s vs CG: 
      1.26 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and total muscular volume (HIRT: 832.4 L vs CG: 649.2 L). 
      CONCLUSIONS: HIRT led to the remission of sarcopenia in half of the older women, 
      as seen in muscle mass, strength, and functional performance and MRI biomarkers, 
      with significant increases in muscle quality. REGISTERED IN CLINICALTRIALS.GOV:

TI  - Near-term fetal hypoxia-ischemia in rabbits: MRI can predict muscle tone 
      abnormalities and deep brain injury.
PG  - 2757-63
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The pattern of antenatal brain injury varies with 
      gestational age at the time of insult. Deep brain nuclei are often injured at 
      older gestational ages. Having previously shown postnatal hypertonia after 
      preterm fetal rabbit hypoxia-ischemia, the objective of this study was to 
      investigate the causal relationship between the dynamic regional pattern of brain 
      injury on MRI and the evolution of muscle tone in the near-term rabbit fetus. 
      METHODS: Serial MRI was performed on New Zealand white rabbit fetuses to 
      determine equipotency of fetal hypoxia-ischemia during uterine ischemia comparing 
      29 days gestation (E29, 92% gestation) with E22 and E25. E29 postnatal kits at 4, 
      24, and 72 hours after hypoxia-ischemia underwent T2- and diffusion-weighted 
      imaging. Quantitative assessments of tone were made serially using a torque 
      apparatus in addition to clinical assessments. RESULTS: Based on the brain 
      apparent diffusion coefficient, 32 minutes of uterine ischemia was selected for 
      E29 fetuses. At E30, 58% of the survivors manifested hind limb hypotonia. By E32, 
      71% of the hypotonic kits developed dystonic hypertonia. Marked and persistent 
      apparent diffusion coefficient reduction in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and 
      brain stem was predictive of these motor deficits. CONCLUSIONS: MRI observation 
      of deep brain injury 6 to 24 hours after near-term hypoxia-ischemia predicts 
      dystonic hypertonia postnatally. Torque-displacement measurements indicate that 
      motor deficits in rabbits progressed from initial hypotonia to hypertonia, 
      similar to human cerebral palsy, but in a compressed timeframe. The presence of 
      deep brain injury and quantitative shift from hypo- to hypertonia may identify 
      patients at risk for developing cerebral palsy.

PG  - 98-104
LID - 10.1097/RCT.0b013e3182772d66 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tensor eigenvalues 
      (λ1, λ2, λ3), fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in 
      healthy lumbar musculature. METHODS: Seventeen healthy subjects (10 men, 7 women; 
      mean age, 28 ± 7 years) were scanned using a 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging. 
      Axial DTI was performed using 15 diffusion directions (b = 400 mm/s) at the L4 
      level. Oswestry Low Back Pain and Godin Physical Activity questionnaires were 
      administered to rule out underlying lower back problems. RESULTS: Skeletal muscle 
      DTI metrics were similar to those previously published. All measurements showed 
      low coefficients of variation, except for quadratus lumborum. Laterality was not 
      significant. Significant sex differences were observed in the quadratus lumborum 
      (P < 0.05). Significant correlations were found between subjects' weight and body 
      mass index with fractional anisotropy and λ1 of the multifidus muscles. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The DTI metrics in paraspinal muscles can be reliably measured and 
      are influenced by body mass index and weight but not by age or physical activity.

TI  - Phosphocreatine kinetics in the calf muscle of patients with bilateral 
      symptomatic peripheral arterial disease during exhaustive incremental exercise.
PG  - 30-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between the atherosclerotic lesion load 
      determined on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and phosphocreatine (PCr) 
      kinetics during incremental, exhaustive calf exercise in patients with bilateral, 
      symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PROCEDURES: Using a 1.5 Tesla MR 
      scanner, 26 patients with bilateral symptomatic PAD and 24 healthy male controls 
      underwent serial phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy (31P MRS) during incremental 
      exercise at 2, 3, 4, and 5 Watts. For each increment and recovery, PCr time 
      constants, amplitudes of PCr changes and pH values were calculated from the MR 
      spectra. In patients, the run-off resistance (ROR) was determined on MRA. 
      RESULTS: The patients exhibited significantly (p <or= 0.002) increased PCr time 
      constants at the first (36.7, 13.8-360.3 vs. 22.9, 9.2-60.7 s), at the second 
      (68.1, 4.2-757.2 vs. 18.3, 5.2-57.6 s), at the third (65.3, 14.7-277.7 vs. 29.0, 
      4.48-97.2 s), the fourth increment (64.1, 34.2-548.8 vs. 34.6, 4.9-106.2 s), and 
      during recovery (53.2, 11.1-353.2 vs. 41.4, 15.1-122.4 s) compared to the normal 
      controls. The PCr on-kinetics during the increments correlated significantly with 
      the pH levels (r= -0.39 to -0.66, p <or= 0.005) at the end of the corresponding 
      increments, but not with the RORs. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between PCr 
      on-kinetics and end-increment pH values might indicate remodelling processes 
      within the muscle that probably affect mitochondrial performance, diffusion of 
      oxygen, and muscle fiber distribution. These parameters could be improved by 
      exercise training.

TI  - Diffusive sensitivity to muscle architecture: a magnetic resonance diffusion 
      tensor imaging study of the human calf.
PG  - 253-62
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the diffusive properties of adjacent muscles 
      at rest, and to determine the relationship between diffusive and architectural 
      properties, which are task-specific to muscles. The principle, second, and third 
      eigenvalues, trace of the diffusion tensor, and two anisotropic parameters, 
      ellipsoid eccentricity (e) and fractional anisotropy (FA), of various muscles in 
      the human calf were calculated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Linear 
      correlations of the calculated parameters to the muscle physiological 
      cross-sectional area (PCSA), which is proportional to maximum muscle force, were 
      performed to ascertain any linear relation between muscle architecture and 
      diffusivity. Images of the left calf were acquired from six healthy male 
      volunteers. Seven muscles were investigated in this study. These comprised the 
      soleus, lateral gastrocnemius, medial gastrocnemius, posterior tibialis, anterior 
      tibialis, extensor digitorum longus, and peroneus longus. All data were presented 
      as the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). In general, differences in 
      diffusive parameter values occurred primarily between functionally different 
      muscles. A strong correlation was also found between PCSA and the third 
      eigenvalue, e, and FA. A mathematical derivation revealed a linear relationship 
      between PCSA and the third eigenvalue as a result of their dependence on the 
      average radius of all fibers within a single muscle. These findings demonstrated 
      the ability of DTI to differentiate between functionally different muscles in the 
      same region of the body on the basis of their diffusive properties.

AB  - OBJECT: The object was to assess whether cross-sectional area (CSA) and water 
      diffusion properties of leg muscles in young and older women change with 
      increased time spent in supine rest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy young (n = 9, 
      aged 20-30 years) and older (n = 9, aged 65-75 years) women underwent MRI 
      scanning of the right leg at baseline, 30 and 60 min of supine rest. Muscle CSA 
      was derived from proton density images. Water diffusion properties [apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA)] of the tibialis 
      anterior and posterior, soleus, and medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius 
      were derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Repeated measures ANOVAs and 
      Bonferroni post hoc tests determined the effects of time and group on each muscle 
      outcome. RESULTS: In both groups, muscle CSA and FA did not significantly change 
      over time, whereas ADC significantly decreased. A greater decline at 30 min for 
      young women was only observed for ADC in the medial gastrocnemius. CONCLUSION: 
      Regardless of age, ADC values decreased with fluid shift associated with time 
      spent supine, whereas CSA and FA were not affected. For leg muscle assessment in 
      young and older women, DTI scanning protocols should consider the amount of time 
      spent in a recumbent position.

TI  - Simultaneous temperature and regional blood volume measurements in human muscle 
      using an MRI fast diffusion technique.
PG  - 371-7
AB  - The thermal dependence of the translational diffusion coefficient and of the 
      regional blood volume was investigated in vivo by using a special MR pulsed 
      gradient technique with reduced sensitivity to bulk tissue motion. Measurements 
      were done at 0.5 T, using a small gradient insert. The diffusion coefficient of 
      muscle water was calibrated against thermocouple-measured temperature in vitro, 
      both with the muscle fibers parallel and perpendicular to the diffusion gradient. 
      The maximum muscle temperature variation obtained by percutaneous conduction was 
      -8.8 +/- 1.6 degrees C under cooling and +3.7 +/- 1.6 degrees C under heating, 
      from basal state. Simultaneously the fractional regional blood volume decreased 
      by a factor of 3.5 under cooling and increased by a factor of 2.7 under heating. 
      Due to the interdependence of microcirculation and tissue temperature, this 
      technique may be used to follow heat production or deposition in living tissue 
      (muscle exercise, electromagnetic irradiation, etc.).

AB  - According to the Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
      1.1, the majority of bone metastases are considered to be nonmeasurable disease. 
      Traditional response criteria rely on physical measurements. New criteria would 
      be valuable if they incorporated newly developed imaging features in order to 
      provide a more comprehensive assessment of oncological status. Advanced magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) sequences such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and 
      perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) perfusion 
      imaging are reviewed in the context of the initial and post-therapeutic 
      assessment of musculoskeletal tumors. Particular attention is directed to the 
      pseudoprogression phenomenon in which a successfully treated tumor enlarges from 
      the pretherapeutic baseline, followed by regression without a change in therapy.

TI  - Comparison of two-compartment exchange and continuum models of dMRI in skeletal 
      muscle.
PG  - 155004
LID - 10.1088/1361-6560/ab2aa6 [doi]
AB  - Clinical diffusion MRI (dMRI) is sensitive to micrometer scale spin 
      displacements, but the image resolution is  ∼mm, so the biophysical 
      interpretation of the signal relies on establishing appropriate subvoxel tissue 
      models. A class of two-compartment exchange models originally proposed by Kärger 
      have been used successfully in neural tissue dMRI. Their use to interpret the 
      signal in skeletal muscle dMRI is challenging because myocyte diameters are 
      comparable to the root-mean-square of spin displacement and their membrane 
      permeability is high. A continuum tissue model consisting of the Bloch-Torrey 
      equation integrated by a hybrid lattice Boltzmann scheme is used for comparison. 
      The validity domain of a classical two-compartment tissue model is probed by 
      comparing it with the prediction of the continuum model for a 2D unidirectional 
      composite continuum model of myocytes embedded in a uniform matrix. This domain 
      is described in terms of two dimensionless parameters inspired by mass transfer 
      phenomena, the Fourier (F) and Biot (B) numbers. The two-compartment model is 
      valid when [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], or when [Formula: see 
      text] and [Formula: see text]. The model becomes less appropriate for muscle dMRI 
      as the cell diameter and volume fraction increase, with the primary source of 
      error associated with modeling diffusion in the extracellular matrix.

TI  - In vivo MR tractography of thigh muscles using diffusion imaging: initial 
      results.
PG  - 3079-85
AB  - The aims of this preliminary study were (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of 
      providing in vivo 3D architecture of human thigh muscles using tractography on a 
      1.5T magnet, and (2) to assess the value of tractography images to obtain 
      averaged microstructural parameters, i.e., the fractional anisotropy (FA) and the 
      mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), over the whole thigh. Five healthy 
      volunteers were included in this study. Their right thighs were imaged using 
      diffusion tensor imaging and gradient-echo T2* sequences. Muscular tractography 
      was performed on each muscle. MR tractography provided a good approach of the 
      muscle shape and of the orientation of the muscle fibers. There was no aberration 
      in the color-encoding scheme nor in the luminosity assigned to each fiber. In 
      contrast, tendons were not drawn in any of the muscles studied. FA values ranged 
      from 0.27 to 0.38. Mean ADC values ranged from 0.76 to 0.96 x 10(-3) mm2/s. Our 
      study demonstrated the feasibility of providing in vivo 3D architecture of human 
      thigh muscles using tractography on a 1.5T magnet, and of determining muscular 
      microstructural parameters (FA and ADC). Musculoskeletal radiologists should be 
      aware of these new developments that may provide complementary information on 
      muscles to the usual sequences.

AB  - OBJECT: To assess post-exercise recovery of human calf muscles using dynamic 
      diffusion tensor imaging (dDTI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI data (6 directions, 
      b = 0 and 400 s/mm(2)) were acquired every 35 s from seven healthy men using a 3T 
      MRI, prior to (4 volumes) and immediately following exercise (13 
      volumes, ~7.5 min). Exercise consisted of 5-min in-bore repetitive 
      dorsiflexion-eversion foot motion with 0.78 kg resistance. Diffusion tensors 
      calculated at each time point produced maps of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional 
      anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and signal at b = 0 s/mm(2) (S(0)). 
      Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was performed on five calf muscles: tibialis 
      anterior (ATIB), extensor digitorum longus (EDL) peroneus longus (PER), soleus 
      (SOL), and lateral gastrocnemius (LG). RESULTS: Active muscles (ATIB, EDL, PER) 
      showed significantly elevated initial MD post-exercise, while predicted inactive 
      muscles (SOL, LG) did not (p < 0.0001). The EDL showed a greater initial increase 
      in MD (1.90 × 10(-4)mm(2)/s) than ATIB (1.03 × 10(-4)mm(2)/s) or PER 
      (8.79 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s) (p = 7.40 × 10(-4)), and remained significantly elevated 
      across more time points than ATIB or PER. Significant increases were observed in 
      post-exercise EDL S(0) relative to other muscles across the majority of time 
      points (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: dDTI can be used to differentiate 
      exercise-induced changes between muscles. These differences are suggested to be 
      related to differences in fiber composition.

TI  - Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging assessment of matrix development in 
      cell-seeded natural urinary bladder smooth muscle tissue-engineered constructs.
PG  - 643-51

AB  - The approach of cell-seeded natural scaffolds holds great promise for tissue 
      engineering complicated soft-tissue organs such as the urinary bladder and heart. 
      However, relatively little is known about cell-natural scaffold interactions or 
      their influence on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characterization, which is 
      valuable for noninvasive monitoring. Ideally, MRI should provide information on 
      tissue biochemistry in addition to structure and function. In this study, 
      quantitative MRI was performed on control and smooth muscle cell-seeded natural 
      bladder matrices at different time points up to 7 days postseeding. Measurements 
      of MR relaxation times (T1 and T2) and diffusion coefficient (D) showed an 
      overall change that was incompatible with cell presence. Multicomponent T2 
      provided greater specificity, revealing time-course changes in the short T2 
      fraction that were consistent with biochemically determined matrix degradation 
      from collagenase released from seeded cells. These matrix alterations are noted 
      for the first time, and their relatively early occurrence may be unique to 
      soft-tissue matrices compared with synthetic materials. More importantly, they 
      are not evident on histology but are revealed on quantitative MRI. We conclude 
      that quantitative MRI may provide specific information on cell-matrix interaction 
      and is a promising noninvasive approach to understand and monitor cell-seeded 
      natural scaffold-based regeneration.

TI  - Measuring anisotropic muscle stiffness properties using elastography.
PG  - 1387-94
LID - 10.1002/nbm.2964 [doi]
AB  - Physiological and pathological changes to the anisotropic mechanical properties 
      of skeletal muscle are still largely unknown, with only a few studies quantifying 
      changes in vivo. This study used the noninvasive MR elastography (MRE) technique, 
      in combination with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to measure shear modulus 
      anisotropy in the human skeletal muscle in the lower leg. Shear modulus 
      measurements parallel and perpendicular to the fibre direction were made in 10 
      healthy subjects in the medial gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior 
      muscles. The results showed significant differences in the medial gastrocnemius 
      (μ‖ = 0.86 ± 0.15 kPa; μ⊥ = 0.66 ± 0.19 kPa, P < 0.001), soleus (μ‖ = 0.83 ± 0.22 
      kPa; μ⊥ = 0.65 ± 0.13 kPa, P < 0.001) and the tibialis anterior (μ‖ = 0.78 ± 0.24 
      kPa; μ⊥ = 0.66 ± 0.16 kPa, P = 0.03) muscles, where the shear modulus measured in 
      the direction parallel is greater than that measured in the direction 
      perpendicular to the muscle fibres. No significant differences were measured 
      across muscle groups. This study provides the first direct estimates of the 
      anisotropic shear modulus in the triceps surae muscle group, and shows that the 
      technique may be useful for the probing of mechanical anisotropy changes caused 
      by disease, aging and injury.

TI  - Spatially resolved kinetics of skeletal muscle exercise response and recovery 
      with multiple echo diffusion tensor imaging (MEDITI): a feasibility study.
PG  - 599-608
LID - 10.1007/s10334-018-0686-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We describe measurement of skeletal muscle kinetics with multiple 
      echo diffusion tensor imaging (MEDITI). This approach allows characterization of 
      the microstructural dynamics in healthy and pathologic muscle. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In a Siemens 3-T Skyra scanner, MEDITI was used to collect dynamic DTI 
      with a combination of rapid diffusion encoding, radial imaging, and compressed 
      sensing reconstruction in a multi-compartment agarose gel rotation phantom and 
      within in vivo calf muscle. An MR-compatible ergometer (Ergospect Trispect) was 
      employed to enable in-scanner plantar flexion exercise. In a HIPAA-compliant 
      study with written informed consent, post-exercise recovery of DTI metrics was 
      quantified in eight volunteers. Exercise response of DTI metrics was compared 
      with that of T2-weighted imaging and characterized by a gamma variate model. 
      RESULTS: Phantom results show quantification of diffusivities in each compartment 
      over its full dynamic rotation. In vivo calf imaging results indicate larger 
      radial than axial exercise response and recovery in the plantar 
      flexion-challenged gastrocnemius medialis (fractional response: 
      nT2w = 0.385 ± 0.244, nMD = 0.163 ± 0.130, nλ(1) = 0.110 ± 0.093, 
      nλ(rad) = 0.303 ± 0.185). Diffusion and T2-weighted response magnitudes were 
      correlated (e.g., r = 0.792, p = 0.019 for nMD vs. nT2w). CONCLUSION: We have 
      demonstrated the feasibility of MEDITI for capturing spatially resolved diffusion 
      tensor data in dynamic systems including post-exercise skeletal muscle recovery 
      following in-scanner plantar flexion.

TI  - Effects of strenuous exercise with eccentric muscle contraction: physiological 
      and functional aspects of human skeletal muscle.
PG  - 179-86
AB  - PURPOSE: we used magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and ultrasonography in 
      combination with a dynamometer to assess physiological and functional aspects of 
      the skeletal muscles after strenuous exercise that included eccentric 
      contraction. METHODS: seven male subjects (mean age, 21.7 years) performed ankle 
      plantar flexion that included eccentric contraction and underwent 
      diffusion-weighted MR imaging for calculation of the apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) of the triceps surae muscles. We used ultrasonography combined 
      with a dynamometer to measure the displacement of the myotendinous junction (MTJ) 
      of the medial gastrocnemius and maximal isometric force during ankle plantar 
      flexion. We also assessed the level of muscle soreness of the calf using a visual 
      analogue scale. We measured these parameters before exercise and one, 2, 3, 5, 
      and 8 days after exercise and examined significant changes from the pre-exercise 
      value using repeated-measures analysis of variance with Dunnett's test for each 
      measurement parameter. RESULTS: one day after exercise, we observed increased 
      muscle soreness (P<0.001) and decreased MTJ displacement (P<0.05); isometric 
      force generation tended to decrease, but the change was not significant. Muscle 
      soreness peaked 2 days after exercise (P<0.001) and remained significantly 
      increased until 5 days after exercise (P<0.005). The medial gastrocnemius 
      exhibited increased ADC value 3 days after exercise (P<0.005), but the lateral 
      gastrocnemius and the soleus showed no significant changes throughout this study. 
      CONCLUSION: our findings suggest that muscle damage induced by eccentric 
      contraction manifests as muscle soreness and dysfunction early after exercise and 
      later increases water diffusion within damaged muscle.

TI  - A comparative evaluation of a RARE-based single-shot pulse sequence for 
      diffusion-weighted MRI of musculoskeletal soft-tissue tumors.
PG  - 772-83
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a centric-reordered 
      modified rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (mRARE) sequence for 
      single-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) of soft-tissue 
      tumors in the musculoskeletal system. In the evaluation of this sequence, DWI was 
      performed in a liquid phantom, in excised human tumor samples embedded in bovine 
      muscle, and in nine patients suffering from different types of soft-tissue 
      tumors. The measurements were compared to DWI using a spin-echo sequence and a 
      single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence. The phantom measurements in water 
      and dimethyl sulfoxide showed a difference of less than 5% when comparing the 
      apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) determined by the mRARE sequence and the 
      two other techniques. Comparing mRARE and EPI, the differences in the ADCs were 
      about 10% in the excised tumor tissue and, typically, about 15% in vivo. ADCs 
      between 0.8 x 10(-3) mm2/s and 1.4 x 10(-3) mm2/s, depending on the tumor type, 
      were found in solid tumor tissue; in cystic tumor areas, ADCs greater than 2.0 x 
      10(-3) mm2/s were determined with the mRARE and the EPI sequences. 
      Diffusion-weighted images of the mRARE sequence were less distorted than those 
      acquired with the single-shot EPI sequence, and provided more anatomic 
      information, since the muscle and fat signals were considerably higher.

AB  - Motor impairment is highly prevalent in HIV-infected patients. Here, we assess 
      associations between peripheral muscular deficits as evaluated by the 5 
      sit-to-stand test (5STS) and structural integrity of the motor system at a 
      central level. Eighty-six HIV-infected patients receiving combination 
      antiretroviral therapy and with no major cerebral events, underwent an MRI scan 
      and the 5STS. Out of 86 participants, forty presented a score greater than two 
      standard deviations above mean normative scores calculated for the 5STS and were 
      therefore considered as motor-impaired. MRI-structural cerebral parameters were 
      compared to the unimpaired participants. Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial 
      Diffusivity (AD) and Radial Diffusivity (RD), reflecting microstructural 
      integrity, were extracted from Diffusion-Tensor MRI. Global and regional cerebral 
      volumes or thicknesses were extracted from 3D-T1 morphological MRI. Whereas the 
      two groups did not differ for any HIV variables, voxel-wise analysis revealed 
      that motor-impaired participants present low FA values in various cortico-motor 
      tracts and low AD in left cortico-spinal tract. However, they did not present 
      reduced volumes or thicknesses of the precentral cortices compared to unimpaired 
      participants. The absence of alterations in cortical regions holding 
      motor-neurons might argue against neurodegenerative process as an explanation of 
      White Matter (WM) disorganization.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to ascertain whether a correlation 
      existed between muscle pennation angle and the ability to successfully perform 
      tractography of the lower leg muscle fibres with deterministic diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) in normal volunteers. METHODS: Fourteen volunteers aged 20-39 (mean 
      28.2 years old) were recruited. All volunteers were scanned using DTI, and six 
      fibre tractographs were constructed from one lower leg of each volunteer, and the 
      'fibre density' was calculated in each of the tractographs. The pennation angle 
      is the angle formed by the muscle fibre and the aponeurosis. The average 
      pennation angle (AVPA) and standard deviation of the pennation angle (SDPA) were 
      also measured for each muscle by ultrasonography in the same region as the MRI 
      scan. For all 84 tractography images, the correlation coefficient between the 
      fibre density and AVPA or SDPA was calculated. RESULTS: Fibre density and AVPA 
      showed a moderate negative correlation (R = -0.72), and fibre density and SDPA 
      showed a weak negative correlation (R = -0.47). With respect to comparisons 
      within each muscle, AVPA and fibre density showed a moderate negative correlation 
      in the gastrocnemius lateralis muscle (R = -0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest 
      that a larger, more variable pennation angle resulted in worse skeletal muscle 
      tractography using deterministic DTI.

TI  - Evaluation of skeletal muscle microvascular perfusion of lower extremities by 
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance arterial spin labeling, blood oxygenation 
      level-dependent, and intravoxel incoherent motion techniques.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noninvasive cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques 
      including arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD), 
      and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), are capable of measuring tissue 
      perfusion-related parameters. We sought to evaluate and compare these three CMR 
      techniques in characterizing skeletal muscle perfusion in lower extremities and 
      to investigate their abilities to diagnose and assess the severity of peripheral 
      arterial disease (PAD). METHODS: Fifteen healthy young subjects, 14 patients with 
      PAD, and 10 age-matched healthy old subjects underwent ASL, BOLD, and IVIM CMR 
      perfusion imaging. Healthy young and healthy old participants were subjected to a 
      cuff-induced ischemia experiment with pressures of 20 mmHg and 40 mmHg above 
      systolic pressure during imaging. Perfusion-related metrics, including blood 
      flow, T2* relaxation time, perfusion fraction f, diffusion coefficient D, and 
      pseudodiffusion coefficient D*, were measured in the anterior, lateral, soleus, 
      and gastrocnemius muscle groups. Friedman, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon signed rank, 
      and Spearman rank correlation tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 
      In cases of significant differences determined by the Friedman test (P < 0.05), 
      blood flow, T2*, and D values gradually decreased, while f values showed a 
      tendency to increase in healthy subjects under cuff compression. No significant 
      correlations were found among the ASL, BOLD, and IVIM parameters (all P > 0.05). 
      Blood flow and T2* values showed significant positive correlations with 
      transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurements (ρ = 0.465 and 0.522, respectively; 
      both P ≤ 0.001), while f values showed a significant negative correlation in 
      healthy young subjects (ρ = - 0.351; P = 0.018). T2* was independent of age in 
      every muscle group. T2* values were significantly decreased in PAD patients 
      compared with healthy old subjects and severe PAD patients compared with 
      mild-to-moderate PAD patients (all P < 0.0125). Significant correlations were 
      found between T2* and ankle-brachial index values in all muscle groups in PAD 
      patients (ρ = 0.644-0.837; all P < 0.0125). Other imaging parameters failed to 
      show benefits towards the diagnosis and disease severity evaluation of PAD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ASL, BOLD, and IVIM provide complementary information regarding 
      tissue perfusion. Compared with ASL and IVIM, BOLD may be a more reliable 
      technique for assessing PAD in the resting state and could thus be applied 
      together with angiography in clinical studies as a tool to comprehensively assess 
      microvascular and macrovascular properties in PAD patients.

TI  - Realistic Electric Field Mapping of Anisotropic Muscle During Electrical 
      Stimulation Using a Combination of Water Diffusion Tensor and Electrical 
      Conductivity.
PG  - S32-38
LID - 10.5213/inj.1734878.439 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To realistically map the electric fields of biological tissues using a 
      diffusion tensor magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (DT-MREIT) 
      method to estimate tissue response during electrical stimulation. METHODS: 
      Imaging experiments were performed using chunks of bovine muscle. Two silver wire 
      electrodes were positioned inside the muscle tissue for electrical stimulation. 
      Electric pulses were applied with a 100-V amplitude and 100-μs width using a 
      voltage stimulator. During electrical stimulation, we collected DT-MREIT data 
      from a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. We adopted the projected current 
      density method to calculate the electric field. Based on the relation between the 
      water diffusion tensor and the conductivity tensor, we computed the 
      position-dependent scale factor using the measured magnetic flux density data. 
      Then, a final conductivity tensor map was reconstructed using the multiplication 
      of the water diffusion tensor and the scale factor. RESULTS: The current density 
      images from DT-MREIT data represent the internal current flows that exist not 
      only in the electrodes but also in surrounding regions. The reconstructed 
      electric filed map from our anisotropic conductivity tensor with the projected 
      current density shows coverage that is more than 2 times as wide, and higher 
      signals in both the electrodes and surrounding tissues, than the previous 
      isotropic method owing to the consideration of tissue anisotropy. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      electric field map obtained by an anisotropic reconstruction method showed 
      different patterns from the results of the previous isotropic reconstruction 
      method. Since accurate electric field mapping is important to correctly estimate 
      the coverage of the electrical treatment, future studies should include more 
      rigorous validations of the new method through in vivo and in situ experiments.

AB  - The soleus is an important plantarflexor muscle with complex fascicle and 
      connective tissue arrangement. In this study we created an image-based finite 
      element model representing the 3D structure of the soleus muscle and its 
      aponeurosis connective tissue, including distinct fascicle architecture of the 
      posterior and anterior compartments. The model was used to simulate passive and 
      active soleus lengthening during ankle motion to predict tissue displacements and 
      fascicle architecture changes. Both the model's initial architecture and changes 
      incurred during passive lengthening were consistent with prior in vivo data from 
      diffusion tensor imaging. Model predictions of active lengthening were consistent 
      with axial plane muscle displacements that we measured in eight subjects' lower 
      legs using cine DENSE (Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes) MRI during 
      eccentric dorsiflexion. Regional strains were variable and nonuniform in the 
      model, but average fascicle strains were similar between the compartments for 
      both passive (anterior: 0.18 ± 0.06, posterior: 0.19 ± 0.05) and active 
      (anterior: 0.12 ± 0.05, posterior: 0.13 ± 0.06) lengthening and were two- to 
      three-times greater than muscle belly strain (0.06). We used additional model 
      simulations to investigate the effects of aponeurosis material properties on 
      muscle deformation, by independently varying the longitudinal or transverse 
      stiffness of the posterior or anterior aponeurosis. Results of model variations 
      elucidate how properties of soleus aponeuroses contribute to fascicle 
      architecture changes. Greater longitudinal stiffness of posterior compared to 
      anterior aponeurosis promoted more uniform spatial distribution of muscle tissue 
      deformation. Reduced transverse stiffness in both aponeuroses resulted in larger 
      differences between passive and active soleus lengthening.

TI  - Addressing spontaneous signal voids in repetitive single-shot DWI of musculature: 
      spatial and temporal patterns in the calves of healthy volunteers and 
      consideration of unintended muscle activities as underlying mechanism.
PG  - 801-10

AB  - Single-shot diffusion-weighted MRI sensitive to different types of incoherent 
      motion inside tissue shows sporadic signal voids with a considerable size (>1 cm) 
      in calf musculature at rest. Spatial and temporal patterns of these signal voids 
      and their dependence on measurement conditions were tested systematically in 
      order to obtain more insight into the underlying mechanism. Lower leg muscles of 
      10 healthy subjects were examined by recording series of 1000 echo-planar 
      single-shot scans with repetition time 500 ms and b-value 100 s/mm(2) . Effects 
      of strength and orientation of motion sensitization gradients and of repetition 
      times were analysed. Potential influences of arterial blood pulsations and 
      positioning of the subject were studied. Comparison of calf muscle groups showed 
      more frequent signal voids in gastrocnemius and soleus muscle compared with 
      tibialis muscles. Large inter-individual variance in the total number of signal 
      voids visible in a transverse slice of the lower leg was observed (minimum 
      40/1000 scans; maximum >550/1000 scans). Typical sizes of the affected muscular 
      areas ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 cm in the transverse and from 1.5 to 7 cm in the 
      head-feet direction. Signal voids occurred nearly independent of the cardiac 
      phase and with similar frequencies for supine and prone positions. Resting calf 
      muscles show spontaneous signal voids in single-shot DWI at low b-values with an 
      irregular temporal and spatial pattern. Values of mean diffusivity, diffusion 
      tensor parameters, and IVIM-derived perfusion are expected to be clearly 
      distorted by such signal voids if no rejection of affected data is applied. 
      Several potential causes for the signal voids are discussed. The most probable 
      explanation for the phenomenon is seen in the occurrence of spontaneous 
      incoherent mechanical activity in musculature based on weak muscle fibre 
      contractions. If this is the case it opens up a new field for studies on the 
      physiological role and regulation of these unintended muscle activities.

TI  - Cerebral white matter structure is disrupted in Gulf War Veterans with chronic 
      musculoskeletal pain.
PG  - 2364-2375
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001038 [doi]
AB  - Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) affects ∼25% of the 700,000 Veterans deployed 
      during the Persian Gulf War (1990-1991). The cause of their pain is unknown, and 
      there are no efficacious treatments. A small body of literature suggests that 
      brain abnormalities exist in Gulf War Veterans (GVs), yet relationships between 
      brain abnormalities and disease symptoms remain largely unexplored. Our purpose 
      was to compare white matter (WM) integrity between GVCMP and matched, healthy 
      Veteran controls (GVCO) and investigate relationships between cerebral WM 
      integrity and symptoms. Thirty GVCMP and 31 controls completed magnetic resonance 
      imaging with diffusion tensor imaging. Tract-based spatial statistics estimated 
      WM fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial 
      diffusivity over the whole brain (P < 0.05) and were corrected using 
      threshold-free cluster enhancement. GVCMP had greater pain symptoms and mood 
      disturbance and lower quality of life and physical function compared with GVCO (P 
      < 0.05). GVCMP had lower WM integrity across several brain regions implicated in 
      chronic pain (P < 0.05) including the middle and inferior frontal gyrus, corpus 
      callosum, corona radiata, precentral gyrus, external capsule, and posterior 
      thalamic radiation. For GVCMP, WM integrity was associated with pain and mood 
      symptoms in widespread brain areas that were found to be different between groups 
      (P < 0.05). Results indicate widespread WM microstructure disruption across brain 
      regions implicated in pain processing and modulation in chronic pain. The 
      observed relationships between WM microstructure and symptoms encourage the 
      testing of treatments designed to improve the brain health of affected Veterans.

TI  - [Diffusion tensor imaging in quantitative evaluation on thigh muscle of male 
      amateur marathon runners after running a half marathon].
PG  - 642-647
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20210716-01591 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of half marathon on thigh muscle in male 
      amateur marathon runners by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods: A total of 
      17 male amateur marathon runners aged from 27 to 57 (43.7±2.8) years were 
      recruited from May to August 2020 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. MRI examination 
      of bilateral thigh muscles were performed before and 3 h, 3 d and 7 d after a 
      half marathon. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values was obtained by DTI 
      sequence. The FA values of rectus femoris, intermedius femoris, medial femoris, 
      lateral femoris, biceps femoris longus, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, adductor 
      magnus and adductor longus were measured on the horizontal axis of bilateral 
      thigh muscles. Friedman M test was used to compare the changes of FA values of 
      each muscle at each time point before and after running, and pairwise comparison 
      of FA values of statistically significant muscles at 3 h, 3 d and 7 d after 
      running was performed. Results: The overall FA value of thigh muscle group [M 
      (Q(1), Q(3))] at 3 h after running was decreased compared to before running [0.24 
      (0.20, 0.28) to 0.25 (0.21, 0.29), P<0.001], and there was no significant 
      difference between baseline values at 3 d and 7 d after running (all P>0.05). FA 
      values of vastus intermedius, vastus medialis, semimembranosus and adductor 
      magnus at 3 h after running were lower than those before running [(0.19 (0.18, 
      0.22) vs 0.21 (0.19, 0.24), 0.19 (0.17, 0.20) vs 0.21 (0.18, 0.23), 0.26 (0.24), 
      0.29) vs 0.27 (0.15, 0.30) and 0.20 (0.19, 0.22) vs 0.21 (0.20, 0.23), both 
      P<0.05], and there was no statistical significance between 3 d and 7 d after 
      running and those before running (all P>0.05). FA value of vastus lateralis 
      muscle at 3 h after running decreased compared with that before running, but the 
      difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). FA value began to increase 
      at 7 d after running, and the difference was statistically significant [0.24 
      (0.21, 0.27) vs 0.23 (0.19, 0.25), P = 0.002]. FA value of rectus femoris muscle 
      at 3 h after running decreased compared with that before running, but the 
      difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05), and began to increase at 3 
      d after running and the difference was statistically significant [0.29 (0.26, 
      0.34) vs 0.26 (0.23, 0.29), P=0.006]. FA value of adductor longus muscle 
      increased at 3 h after running, but the difference was not statistically 
      significant (P>0.05). FA value continued to increase at 3 d and 7 d after 
      running, and the difference was statistically significant [0.23 (0.21, 0.25) vs 
      0.22 (0.19, 0.24), 0.23 (0.21, 0.26) vs 0.22 (0.19, 0.24), all P<0.05]. 
      Conclusions: The change of FA value of thigh muscle after half marathon is 
      reversible. At 3 h after half marathon, FA values of femoris intermedius, femoris 
      medialis, semimembranosus muscle and adductor magnus muscle of amateur marathon 
      runners decreased most obviously, which may be the dominant muscle group during 
      running.

TI  - Three-dimensional architecture of human medial gastrocnemius fascicles in vivo: 
      Regional variation and its dependence on muscle size.
PG  - 1324-1335
LID - 10.1111/joa.13750 [doi]
AB  - Fascicle architecture (length and pennation angle) can vary regionally within a 
      muscle. The architectural variability in human muscles has been evaluated in 
      vivo, but the interindividual variation and its determinants remain unclear. 
      Considering that within-muscle non-uniform changes in pennation angle are 
      associated with change in muscle size by chronic mechanical loading, we 
      hypothesized that the regional variation in fascicle architecture is dependent on 
      interindividual variation in muscle size. To test this hypothesis, we 
      reconstructed fascicles three-dimensionally along and across the whole medial 
      gastrocnemius in the right lower leg of 15 healthy adults (10 males and 5 
      females, 23.7 ± 3.3 years, 165.8 ± 8.3 cm, 61.9 ± 11.4 kg, mean ± standard 
      deviation) in neutral ankle joint position with the knee fully extended, using 
      magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and tractography. The 
      3D-reconstructed fascicles arose from the deep aponeurosis with variable lengths 
      and angles both in sagittal and coronal planes. The fascicle length was 
      significantly longer in the middle (middle-medial: 52.4 ± 6.1 mm, middle-lateral: 
      52.0 ± 5.1 mm) compared to distal regions (distal-medial: 41.0 ± 5.0 mm, 
      distal-lateral: 38.9 ± 3.6 mm, p < 0.001). The 2D pennation angle (angle relative 
      to muscle surface) was significantly greater in distal than middle regions, and 
      medial than lateral regions (middle-medial: 26.6 ± 3.1°, middle-lateral: 
      24.1 ± 2.3°, distal-medial: 31.2 ± 3.6°, distal-lateral: 29.2 ± 3.0°, p ≤ 0.017), 
      while only a proximo-distal difference was significant (p < 0.001) for 3D 
      pennation angle (angle relative to line of action of muscle). These results 
      clearly indicate fascicle's architectural variation in 3D. The magnitude of 
      regional variation evaluated as standard deviation across regions differed 
      considerably among individuals (4.0-10.7 mm for fascicle length, 0.9-5.0° for 2D 
      pennation angle, and 3.0-8.8° for 3D pennation angle), which was positively 
      correlated with the muscle volume normalized to body mass (r = 0.659-0.828, 
      p ≤ 0.008). These findings indicate muscle-size dependence of the variability of 
      fascicle architecture.

TI  - Three-dimensional muscular architecture of the human tongue determined in vivo 
      with diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The myoarchitecture of the tongue is believed to consist of a complex network of 
      interwoven fibers, which function together to produce a near limitless array of 
      functional deformations. These deformations contribute mechanically to speech 
      production and to oral cavity food handling during swallowing. We have previously 
      imaged the 3D myoarchitecture of the mammalian tongue in excised tissue with 
      diffusion tensor MRI, a technique which derives the 3D orientation of intramural 
      fibers as a function of the extent to which a direction-specific MR signal 
      attenuates under diffusion-encoding magnetic gradients. The resulting 3D 
      diffusion tensor defines the relative orientations of the myofiber populations 
      within a region of tissue. In this study, we have extended the use of this method 
      to assess lingual myoarchitecture in normal human subjects in vivo. Subjects were 
      imaged using a diffusion-sensitive stimulated-echo pulse sequence with 
      single-shot echo-planar spatial encoding in the midsagittal plane. Differences in 
      lingual fiber orientation were manifested by graduated changes in fiber direction 
      throughout the tissue, without clear anatomical demarcations between regions of 
      the tissue. The anterior tissue was composed generally of orthogonally oriented 
      fibers surrounded by an axially oriented ring of tissue, whereas the posterior 
      portion of the tissue was composed mostly of fibers projecting in the superior 
      and posterior directions. The bulk of the tissue displayed a highly homogeneous, 
      vertically oriented set of fibers, including the anteroinferior region of the 
      tissue and extending nearly to the superior surface. Further analysis of the 
      tissue in terms of diffusion anisotropy demonstrated that the tissue could be 
      represented by varying degrees of anisotropy, with a tendency toward high 
      anisotropy in the dorsal and anteroventral periphery and low anisotropy in the 
      central region of the tissue. These findings demonstrate that the muscular 
      anatomy of the tongue can be displayed as a continuous array of structural units, 
      or tensors, representing fibers of varying orientations throughout the tissue.

TI  - Evaluation of the value of the VI-RADS scoring system in assessing muscle 
      infiltration by bladder cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) was created 
      in 2018, and a 5-point VI-RADS scoring system was proposed to determine whether 
      the muscularis of the bladder has been infiltrated by tumor tissues. PURPOSE: To 
      verify the accuracy of the VI-RADS scoring system in predicting muscle-invasive 
      bladder cancer and to explore its value in clinical application. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A total of 220 patients with bladder cancer who underwent multiparameter 
      magnetic resonance imaging from January 2017 to June 2019 were selected. Then, 
      two radiologists with equivalent qualifications gave their diagnoses of bladder 
      tumors on T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast 
      enhanced imaging. Meanwhile, the bladder tumor was also scored on the basis of 
      the VI-RADS system; for multifocal tumors, the highest tumor load was selected 
      for scoring. Furthermore, the final pathological results of the patients were 
      unknown during the imaging diagnosis and scoring. Next, the VI-RADS score was 
      compared with the pathological results after surgery, and the ability of the 
      VI-RADS score to assess the degree of muscularis infiltration was finally 
      analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 220 patients were included in our study, including 
      194 males and 26 females. Among them, the pathological results were 113 cases of 
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer and 107 cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder 
      cancer. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between the 
      pathological results and VI-RADS score (r = 0.821, P < 0.05). The area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve of the VI-RADS score was 0.960 (95% CI: 
      0.937, 0.983). When the VI-RADS score was above 3, the sensitivity, specificity 
      and accuracy of predicting muscle-invasive bladder cancer were 82.3, 95.3 and 
      88.64%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The VI-RADS scoring system has good diagnostic 
      value in predicting the degree of tumor invasion and can be used to guide 
      clinical decision-making and management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the inter-observer and inter-vendor reliability of 
      diffusion tensor imaging parameters in the musculoskeletal system. METHODS: This 
      prospective study included six healthy volunteers three men (mean age: 42; range: 
      31-52 years) and three women (mean age: 36; range: 30-44 years). Each subject was 
      scanned using different 3 Tesla magnetic resonance scanners from three different 
      vendors at three different sites bilaterally. First, the intra-class correlation 
      coefficient was used to determine between-observers agreement for overall 
      measurements and clinical sites. Next, between-group comparisons were made 
      through the nonparametric Friedman's test. Finally, the Bland-Altman method was 
      used to determine agreement among the three scanner measurements, comparing them 
      two by two. RESULTS: A total of 792 measurement were calculated. ICC reported 
      high levels of agreement between the two observers. ICC related to MD, FA, and RD 
      measurements ranged from 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.90) to 0.95 (95% CI 0.94-0.96), from 
      0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.88) to 0.95 (95% CI 0.93-0.96), and from 0.89 (0.85-0.90) to 
      0.92 (0.90-0.94). No statistically significant inter-vendor differences were 
      observed. The Bland-Altmann method confirmed a high correlation between parameter 
      values. CONCLUSION: An excellent inter-observer and inter-vendor reliability was 
      found in our study.

TI  - Piriformis muscle syndrome with assessment of sciatic nerve using diffusion 
      tensor imaging and tractography: a case report.
PG  - 1399-1404
LID - 10.1007/s00256-017-2690-x [doi]
AB  - Piriformis muscle syndrome (PMS) is difficult to diagnose by objective evaluation 
      of sciatic nerve injury. Here we report a case of PMS diagnosed by diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of the sciatic nerve, which can assess and 
      visualize the extent of nerve injury. The patient was a 53-year-old man with a 
      2-year history of continuous pain and numbness in the left leg. His symptoms 
      worsened when sitting. Physical examination, including sensorimotor neurologic 
      tests, the deep tendon reflex test, and the straight leg raise test, revealed no 
      specific findings. The hip flexion adduction and internal rotation test and 
      resisted contraction maneuvers for the piriformis muscle were positive. There 
      were no abnormal findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar 
      spine. The transverse diameter of piriformis muscle was slightly thicker in 
      affected side on MRI of the pelvis. A single DTI sequence was performed during 
      MRI of the pelvis. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) of the sciatic nerve were quantified at three levels using the 
      fiber-tracking method. FA values were significantly lower and ADC values were 
      significantly higher distal to the piriformis muscle. We performed 
      endoscopic-assisted resection of the piriformis tendon. Intraoperatively, the 
      motor-evoked potentials in the left gastrocnemius were improved by resection of 
      the piriformis tendon. The patient's symptoms improved immediately after surgery. 
      There was no significant difference in FA or ADC at any level between the 
      affected side and the unaffected side 3 months postoperatively. MRI-DTI may aid 
      the diagnosis of PMS.

TI  - Self diffusion of water in frog muscle.
PG  - 107-16
AB  - Self diffusion of cell water has been measured at diffusion times ranging form 
      0.3 ms to 2.4 s for three muscle types of Rana pipiens, using various magnetic 
      field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance methods. Intracellular diffusion 
      coefficients and membrane permeabilities are calculated with the aid of previous 
      theoretical results for regularly spaced permeable planar barriers. The 
      intracellular diffusion coefficient is 1.6 x 10-5 cm2/s, in approximate agreement 
      with other literature values for skeletal muscles. The outer membrane 
      permeabilities are estimated at 0.01 cm/s for two of the muscle types, and much 
      higher for the other one.

TI  - Initial experience of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to assess 
      therapeutic response to induction chemoradiotherapy against muscle-invasive 
      bladder cancer.
PG  - 387-91
LID - 10.1016/j.urology.2009.06.111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of diffusion-weighted magnetic 
      resonance imaging (DWI) in predicting therapeutic response to low-dose 
      chemoradiotherapy (LCRT) against muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Accurate 
      assessment of response to induction therapy is an essential part of 
      bladder-sparing therapeutic protocols against MIBC. However, conventional imaging 
      studies are not useful in evaluating therapeutic response because of their 
      inability to distinguish residual cancer from changes secondary to the treatment. 
      METHODS: Twenty patients with clinical T2-4aN0M0 bladder urothelial carcinoma 
      (T2/T3/T4a: n = 10/8/2) who underwent induction LCRT comprising external beam 
      radiotherapy to the bladder (40 Gy) concomitant with 2 cycles of cisplatin 
      administration (20 mg/d for 5 days) followed by partial (n = 13) or radical 
      cystectomy (n = 7) were prospectively enrolled. The patients underwent magnetic 
      resonance imaging examinations with T2-weighted imaging (T2W), dynamic 
      contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (DCE), and DWI after LCRT. A finding of 
      each protocol was compared with a pathologic finding of cystectomy specimen. 
      RESULTS: Pathologic examination of cystectomy specimens revealed pathologic 
      complete response in 13 (65%) of the 20 patients. The 
      sensitivity/specificity/accuracy of T2W, DCE, and DWI in predicting pathologic 
      response was 43/45/44%, 57/18/33%, and 57/92/80%, respectively. Despite 
      comparable sensitivity, DWI was significantly superior in specificity and 
      accuracy to T2W (P = .03 and .02, respectively) and DCE (P = .002 for both). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show the feasibility of DWI over T2W and 
      DCE for assessing therapeutic response to induction chemoradiotherapy against 
      MIBC. The high specificity of DWI indicates that DWI is useful to accurately 
      predict pathologic complete response, allowing more optimal patient selection in 
      bladder-sparing protocols.

AB  - People who have had a stroke often develop ankle contractures which may be caused 
      by changes in architecture of calf muscles. Anatomically constrained diffusion 
      tensor imaging has recently been used to make three-dimensional, whole-muscle 
      measurements of muscle architecture. Here, we compared the architecture of the 
      medial gastrocnemius muscle in the paretic and non-paretic sides of people who 
      have had a hemiparetic stroke and control participants using novel imaging 
      techniques. METHODS: MRI techniques (diffusion tensor imaging and mDixon imaging) 
      were used to obtain muscle volume, fascicle length, pennation angle, 
      physiological cross-sectional area and curvature in 14 stroke patients (mean age 
      60 SD 13 years) and 18 control participants (mean age 66 SD 12 years). FINDINGS: 
      On average, the ankle on the paretic side had 11° (95% confidence interval 8 to 
      13°) less dorsiflexion range than on the non-paretic side, and 6° (1 to 13°) less 
      dorsiflexion range than ankles of control participants. The medial gastrocnemius 
      muscles on the paretic side were, on average, 15% (35.2 cm(3), 95% confidence 
      interval 5.2 to 65.2 cm(3)) smaller in volume than the muscles on the non-paretic 
      side, and 16% (36.9 cm(3), 95% confidence interval 3.1 to 70.6 cm(3)) smaller 
      than in control participants. No statistically significant differences between 
      paretic, non-paretic and control muscles were detected for fascicle length, 
      pennation angle, physiological cross-sectional area or curvature. CONCLUSIONS: 
      People with hemiparetic stroke and reduced range of motion have, on average, a 
      smaller medial gastrocnemius muscle on the paretic side than on the non-paretic 
      side. Other muscle architectural parameters appear unchanged.

AB  - Despite the importance of pelvic floor muscles, significant controversy still 
      exists about the true structural details of these muscles. We provide an 
      objective analysis of the architecture and orientation of the superficial muscles 
      of the perineum using a novel approach. Magnetic Resonance Diffusion Tensor 
      Images (MR-DTI) were acquired in 10 healthy asymptomatic nulliparous women, and 4 
      healthy males. Global tractography was then used to generate the architecture of 
      the muscles. Micro-CT imaging of a male cadaver was performed for validation of 
      the fiber tracking results. Results show that muscles fibers of the external anal 
      sphincter, from the right and left side, cross midline in the region of the 
      perineal body to continue as transverse perinea and bulbospongiosus muscles of 
      the opposite side. The morphology of the external anal sphincter resembles that 
      of the number '8' or a "purse string". The crossing of muscle fascicles in the 
      perineal body was supported by micro-CT imaging in the male subject. The 
      superficial muscles of the perineum, and external anal sphincter are frequently 
      damaged during child birth related injuries to the pelvic floor; we propose the 
      use of MR-DTI based global tractography as a non-invasive imaging technique to 
      assess damage to these muscles.

AB  - 'Gold standard' reference sets of human muscle architecture are based on elderly 
      cadaveric specimens, which are unlikely to be representative of a large 
      proportion of the human population. This is important for musculoskeletal 
      modeling, where the muscle force-generating properties of generic models are 
      defined by these data but may not be valid when applied to models of young, 
      healthy individuals. Obtaining individualized muscle architecture data in vivo is 
      difficult, however diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) has recently 
      emerged as a valid method of achieving this. DTI was used here to provide an 
      architecture data set of 20 lower limb muscles from 10 healthy adults, including 
      muscle fiber lengths, which are important inputs for Hill-type muscle models 
      commonly used in musculoskeletal modeling. Maximum isometric force and muscle 
      fiber lengths were found not to scale with subject anthropometry, suggesting that 
      these factors may be difficult to predict using scaling or optimization 
      algorithms. These data also highlight the high level of anatomical variation that 
      exists between individuals in terms of lower limb muscle architecture, which 
      supports the need of incorporating subject-specific force-generating properties 
      into musculoskeletal models to optimize their accuracy for clinical evaluation.

TI  - Evaluation of diffusional anisotropy and microscopic structure in skeletal 
      muscles using magnetic resonance.
PG  - 19-25
AB  - The pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method is 
      used for detecting the diffusion of water molecules in biological tissues. 
      Because tissues generally have diffusional anisotropy, their diffusion properties 
      are denoted by a tensor. In this study, we evaluated the diffusional anisotropy 
      and microscopic structure in atrophied skeletal muscles using the PGSE NMR 
      method. The left sciatic nerve was severed in twelve 9-week-old rats. Neurotomy 
      caused neurogenic muscular atrophy at the left gastrocnemius. At 2, 4 and 8 weeks 
      after neurotomy, magnetic resonance signals were selectively acquired from a 2 x 
      2 x 2 mm(3) voxel, which was located on the left gastrocnemius. The diffusion 
      tensor, the mean diffusivity (MD) and the fractional anisotropy (FA) were 
      calculated from the signals. A theoretical model of the diffusion in muscles was 
      derived from Tanner's equation. The muscle fiber diameter was estimated by 
      fitting the model to the measured signals. The measurements were also performed 
      for normal rats as controls. No significant difference was found in the MD and 
      the estimated intracellular diffusion coefficient between the control group and 
      the denervated group. The denervated group had significantly higher FA compared 
      with the control group (P<.05). The estimated muscle fiber diameter of the 
      denervated group was significantly smaller than the estimated value of the 
      control group (P<.05). These differences were found at 8 weeks after neurotomy. 
      The proposed method is effective for evaluating changes in the microscopic 
      structure of skeletal muscles.

TI  - Quantitative muscle MRI displays clinically relevant myostructural abnormalities 
      in long-term ICU-survivors: a case-control study.
PG  - 38
LID - 10.1186/s12880-023-00995-7 [doi]
LID - 38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term data on ICU-survivors reveal persisting sequalae and a 
      reduced quality-of-life even after years. Major complaints are neuromuscular 
      dysfunction due to Intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW). Quantitative 
      MRI (qMRI) protocols can quantify muscle alterations in contrast to standard 
      qualitative MRI-protocols. METHODS: Using qMRI, the aim of this study was to 
      analyse persisting myostructural abnormalities in former ICU patients compared to 
      controls and relate them to clinical assessments. The study was conducted as a 
      cohort/case-control study. Nine former ICU-patients and matched controls were 
      recruited (7 males; 54.8y ± 16.9; controls: 54.3y ± 11.1). MRI scans were 
      performed on a 3T-MRI including a mDTI, T2 mapping and a mDixonquant sequence. 
      Water T2 times, fat-fraction and mean values of the eigenvalue (λ(1)), mean 
      diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were 
      obtained for six thigh and seven calf muscles bilaterally. Clinical assessment 
      included strength testing, electrophysiologic studies and a questionnaire on 
      quality-of-life (QoL). Study groups were compared using a multivariate general 
      linear model. qMRI parameters were correlated to clinical assessments and QoL 
      questionnaire using Pearson´s correlation. RESULTS: qMRI parameters were 
      significantly higher in the patients for fat-fraction (p < 0.001), water T2 time 
      (p < 0.001), FA (p = 0.047), MD (p < 0.001) and RD (p < 0.001). Thighs and calves 
      showed a different pattern with significantly higher water T2 times only in the 
      calves. Correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation of muscle 
      strength (MRC sum score) with FA and T2-time. The results were related to 
      impairment seen in QoL-questionnaires, clinical testing and electrophysiologic 
      studies. CONCLUSION: qMRI parameters show chronic next to active muscle 
      degeneration in ICU survivors even years after ICU therapy with ongoing clinical 
      relevance. Therefore, qMRI opens new doors to characterize and monitor muscle 
      changes of patients with ICUAW. Further, better understanding on the underlying 
      mechanisms of the persisting complaints could contribute the development of 
      personalized rehabilitation programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to use a magnetic resonance (MR) plaque imaging technique to 
      establish the plaque/muscle ratio (PMR) index panel to identify vulnerable 
      plaques in subjects undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS). METHODS: Between 
      2008 and 2010 we treated 69 patients (71 lesions) by elective carotid 
      endarterectomy (CEA) and 35 patients (36 lesions) by CAS. All patients underwent 
      preoperative MR plaque imaging and the ratio of plaque signal intensity to the 
      sternocleidomastoid muscle was calculated. In the CEA group, we categorized the 
      histopathological findings made on the surgical specimens. In the CAS group, we 
      assessed the post-procedure diffusion-weighted images. RESULTS: PMR index panels 
      for each plaque type were created using the cut-off value obtained from the 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of each plaque type. The 
      probability of each of the four plaque types on each panel was assessed by 
      Fisher's exact test. Multinomial logistic regression analysis of the DWI-positive 
      findings determined significant probability (p=0.042). CONCLUSION: The results of 
      this study suggest quantitative evaluation using the PMR index panel has a 
      probability to predict both the plaque type and risk of embolism in patients 
      being considered for treatment with CAS.

TI  - Muscle percentage index as a marker of disease severity in golden retriever 
      muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 621-628
LID - 10.1002/mus.26657 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a spontaneous 
      X-linked canine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy that resembles the human 
      condition. Muscle percentage index (MPI) is proposed as an imaging biomarker of 
      disease severity in GRMD. METHODS: To assess MPI, we used MRI data acquired from 
      nine GRMD samples using a 4.7 T small-bore scanner. A machine learning approach 
      was used with eight raw quantitative mapping of MRI data images (T1m, T2m, two 
      Dixon maps, and four diffusion tensor imaging maps), three types of texture 
      descriptors (local binary pattern, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, gray-level 
      run-length matrix), and a gradient descriptor (histogram of oriented gradients). 
      RESULTS: The confusion matrix, averaged over all samples, showed 93.5% of muscle 
      pixels classified correctly. The classification, optimized in a leave-one-out 
      cross-validation, provided an average accuracy of 80% with a discrepancy in 
      overestimation for young (8%) and old (20%) dogs. DISCUSSION: MPI could be useful 
      for quantifying GRMD severity, but careful interpretation is needed for severe 
      cases.

TI  - Effect of brine injection on water dynamics in postmortem muscle: study of T2 and 
      diffusion coefficients by MR microscopy.
PG  - 259-67
AB  - The dynamics of water in postmortem muscle were studied by magnetic resonance 
      microscopy (MRM). Rabbit muscles were arterially injected with 3 and 5 M NaCl 
      brine. T2 and diffusion mapping were performed during the onset of rigor mortis. 
      A wide spread of T2 values and widely differing postmortem evolutions were 
      observed for injected muscles, whereas T2 was spatially homogeneous for intact 
      muscle. Also, highly variable spatial distribution of diffusion coefficients 
      along (Dz) and across (Dx) the muscle fibers was observed and diffusion 
      anisotropy Dz/Dx) was less marked in injected muscles. The results indicate 
      heterogeneity of brine distribution far from the injection site soon after 
      injection. The postmortem evolution of the parameters is discussed in terms of 
      structural changes induced by brine injection. MRM provides insight into how 
      water dynamics respond to different NaCl concentrations inside muscle.

TI  - A preliminary investigation of mechanisms by which short-term resistance training 
      increases strength of partially paralysed muscles in people with spinal cord 
      injury.
PG  - 770-777

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Pretest-posttest design. OBJECTIVES: To investigate mechanisms by 
      which short-term resistance training (6 weeks) increases strength of partially 
      paralysed muscles in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: 
      Community-based setting, Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Ten community-dwelling 
      people with partial paralysis of elbow flexor, elbow extensor, knee flexor or 
      knee extensor muscles following SCI (range 5 months to 14 years since injury). 
      METHODS: Muscle architecture and strength were assessed before and after 
      participants underwent a six week strength-training program targeting one 
      partially paralysed muscle group. The outcome of primary interest was 
      physiological cross sectional area (PCSA) of the trained muscle group measured 
      using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Other 
      outcomes were changes in mean muscle fascicle length, muscle volume, pennation 
      angle, isometric strength and muscle strength graded on a 13-point scale. 
      RESULTS: The mean increase in maximal isometric muscle strength was 14% (95% CI, 
      -3 to 30%) and 1.5 points (95% CI, 0.5 to 2.5) on the 13-point manual muscle 
      test. There was no evidence of a change in muscle architecture. CONCLUSION: This 
      study is the first to examine the mechanisms by which voluntary strength training 
      increases strength of partially paralysed muscles in people with SCI. The data 
      suggest that strength gains produced by six weeks of strength training are not 
      caused by changes in muscle architecture. This suggests short-term strength gains 
      are due to increased neural drive or an increase in specific muscle tension.

TI  - Impact of the bladder detrusor muscular ring on lower urinary tract symptoms due 
      to benign prostatic hyperplasia: A quantitative MRI analysis.
PG  - 259-267
LID - 10.1002/pros.24457 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign 
      prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH) remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our 
      study was to quantitatively analyze anatomic characteristics on magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) to assess novel independent factors for symptoms. 
      METHODS: This retrospective single-institution study evaluated treatment-naïve 
      men who underwent prostate MRI within 3 months of international prostate symptom 
      score (IPSS) scoring from June 2021 to February 2022. Factors measured on MRI 
      included: size of the detrusor muscular ring (DMR) surrounding the bladder 
      outlet, central gland (CG) mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), levator 
      hiatus (LH) volume, intrapelvic volume, intravesicular prostate protrusion (IPP) 
      volume, CG volume, peripheral zone (PZ) volume, prostate urethra angle (PUA), and 
      PZ background ordinal score. Multivariable logistic regression and receiver 
      operating characteristic analysis were used to analyze factors for 
      moderate/severe (IPSS ≥ 8) and severe LUTS/BPH (IPSS ≥ 20). RESULTS: A total of 
      303 men (mean age: 66.1 [SD: 8.1]) were included: 154 demonstrated moderate or 
      severe symptoms with 28 severe and 149 with asymptomatic/mild symptoms. 
      Increasing age [p = 0.02; odds ratio (OR): 1.05 (1.01-1.08)], PUA [p = 0.02; OR: 
      1.05 (1.01-1.09)], LH volume [p = 0.04; OR: 1.02 (1.00-1.05)], and DMR size 
      measured as diameter [p < 0.001; OR: 5.0 (3.01-8.38)] or area [p < 0.001; OR: 
      1.92 (1.47-2.49)] were significantly independently associated with 
      moderate/severe symptoms, with BMI [p = 0.02; OR: 0.93 (0.88-0.99)] inversely 
      related. For every one cm increase in DMR diameter, patients had approximately 
      five times the odds for moderate/severe symptoms. Increasing DMR size [diameter 
      p < 0.001; OR: 2.74 (1.76-4.27) or area p < 0.001; OR: 1.37 (1.18-1.58)] was 
      independently associated with severe symptoms. Optimal criterion cutoff of DMR 
      diameter for moderate/severe symptoms was 1.2 cm [sensitivity: 77.3; specificity: 
      71.8; AUC: 0.80 (0.75-0.84)]. Inter-reader reliability was excellent for DMR 
      diameter [ICC = 0.92 (0.90-0.94)]. CONCLUSION: Expansion of the DMR surrounding 
      the bladder outlet is a novel anatomic factor independently associated with 
      moderate and severe LUTS/BPH, taking into account prostate volumes, including 
      quantified IPP volume, which were unrelated. Detrusor ring diameter, easily and 
      reliably measured on routine prostate MRI, may relate to detrusor dysfunction 
      from chronic stretching of this histologically distinct smooth muscle around the 
      bladder neck.

TI  - MR spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging of the brain in congenital muscular 
      dystrophy with merosin deficiency: metabolite level decreases, fractional 
      anisotropy decreases, and apparent diffusion coefficient increases in the white 
      matter.
PG  - 317-21
AB  - Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 
      one patient with merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDCMD) revealed 
      significant metabolite (choline, creatine, N-acetyl aspartate) level reductions, 
      fractional anisotropy (FA) reduction and increased apparent diffusion coefficient 
      (ADC) in the white matter (p<0.01, all). In the gray matter, the MRS properties 
      did not differ significantly from those in controls. The ADC and FA, however, 
      differed significantly as in the white matter, although the differences were less 
      pronounced. This is the first quantitative MR study of the brain in a patient 
      with MDCMD, which revealed that the concentrations of all MRS measured 
      metabolites were decreased only in the white matter. This observation, combined 
      with the DTI observed ADC increases and FA decrease, indicated a presence of 
      vasogenic edema in the white matter.

TI  - Comparison of ADC values in different malignancies of the skeletal musculature: a 
      multicentric analysis.
PG  - 995-1000
LID - 10.1007/s00256-015-2141-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides essential information 
      regarding tumor composition, such as cellularity and/or perfusion. DWI is helpful 
      in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. Malignant 
      intramuscular/soft tissue lesions consist of a wide spectrum of tumors that have 
      different cell counts and matrix. It is presumed that these different tumors have 
      different DWI findings and have different apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 
      values. The aim of this study was to analyze DWI findings of different 
      intramuscular malignancies in a multicentric study by using a standardized DWI 
      protocol, and to compare the ADC values acquired. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data 
      banks of four radiology departments were screened retrospectively for malignant 
      intramuscular tumors. Only lesions that were investigated by MRI (with a 1.5-T 
      scanner) using DWI (multishot EPI sequence with b values of 0 and 1,000 s/mm(2)) 
      were included in the study. Overall, 51 patients (28 women, 23 men; mean age 
      58.8 ± 16.1 years) with 57 different malignant intramuscular lesions were 
      collected. In every case apparent diffusion constant (ADC) maps were calculated. 
      In 14 patients muscle lymphoma, 11 patients intramuscular metastases from 
      different primary tumors, and in 26 cases several muscle sarcomas were 
      identified. RESULTS: The mean ADC value of the estimated lesions was 
      1.24 ± 0.53 × 10(-3) mm(2)s(-1), median value, 1.11 × 10(-3) mm(2)s(-1), range, 
      0.54-2.9 × 10(-3) mm(2)s(-1). The mean ADC value in muscle metastases was 
      1.28 ± 0.24 × 10(-3) mm(2)s(-1), in muscle lymphoma 0.76 ± 0.14 × 10(-3) 
      mm(2)s(-1), and in muscle sarcomas 1.82 ± 0.63 × 10(-3) mm(2)s(-1). Muscle 
      lymphoma showed statistically significant lower ADC values in comparison to 
      muscle metastases (p = 0.01) and muscle sarcoma (p = 0.001). There was no 
      significant differences between ADC values in muscle metastases and sarcomas 
      (p = 0.48). ADC values in muscle lymphoma were homogeneous with less 
      inter-patient variability and were within a relatively close range. Muscle 
      sarcomas had a broad range of ADC values. CONCLUSION: Intramuscular malignant 
      lesions had different ADC values on DWI. 22.8% of the tumors analyzed had low ADC 
      values, 26.3% moderate, and 50.9% high ADC values. Muscle lymphoma had 
      statistically significantly lower ADC values in comparison to muscle metastases 
      and sarcomas. Muscle sarcomas presented with a broad range of ADC values.

TI  - Improved olefinic fat suppression in skeletal muscle DTI using a magnitude-based 
      dixon method.
PG  - 152-159
LID - 10.1002/mrm.26655 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a method of suppressing the multi-resonance fat signal in 
      diffusion-weighted imaging of skeletal muscle. This is particularly important 
      when imaging patients with muscular dystrophies, a group of diseases which cause 
      gradual replacement of muscle tissue by fat. THEORY AND METHODS: The signal from 
      the olefinic fat peak at 5.3 ppm can significantly confound diffusion-tensor 
      imaging measurements. Dixon olefinic fat suppression (DOFS), a magnitude-based 
      chemical-shift-based method of suppressing the olefinic peak, is proposed. It is 
      verified in vivo by performing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based 
      quantification in the lower leg of seven healthy volunteers, and compared to two 
      previously described fat-suppression techniques in regions with and without fat 
      contamination. RESULTS: In the region without fat contamination, DOFS produces 
      similar results to existing techniques, whereas in muscle contaminated by 
      subcutaneous fat signal moved due to the chemical shift artefact, it consistently 
      showed significantly higher (P = 0.018) mean diffusivity (MD). Because fat 
      presence lowers MD, this suggests improved fat suppression. CONCLUSION: DOFS 
      offers superior fat suppression and enhances quantitative measurements in the 
      muscle in the presence of fat. DOFS is an alternative to spectral olefinic fat 
      suppression. Magn Reson Med 79:152-159, 2018. © 2017 International Society for

TI  - Normalized STEAM-based diffusion tensor imaging provides a robust assessment of 
      muscle tears in football players: preliminary results of a new approach to 
      evaluate muscle injuries.
PG  - 2882-2889
LID - 10.1007/s00330-017-5218-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess acute muscle tears in professional football players by 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and evaluate the impact of normalization of data. 
      METHODS: Eight football players with acute lower limb muscle tears were examined. 
      DTI metrics of the injured muscle and corresponding healthy contralateral muscle 
      and of ROIs drawn in muscle tears (ROI(tear)) in the corresponding healthy 
      contralateral muscle (ROI(hc_t)) in a healthy area ipsilateral to the injury 
      (ROI(hi)) and in a corresponding contralateral area (ROI(hc_i)) were compared. 
      The same comparison was performed for ratios of the injured (ROI(tear)/ROI(hi)) 
      and contralateral sides (ROI(hc_t)/ROI(hc_i)). ANOVA, Bonferroni-corrected 
      post-hoc and Student's t-tests were used. RESULTS: Analyses of the entire muscle 
      did not show any differences (p>0.05 each) except for axial diffusivity (AD; 
      p=0.048). ROI(tear) showed higher mean diffusivity (MD) and AD than ROI(hc_t) 
      (p<0.05). Fractional anisotropy (FA) was lower in ROI(tear) than in ROI(hi) and 
      ROI(hc_t) (p<0.05). Radial diffusivity (RD) was higher in ROI(tear) than in any 
      other ROI (p<0.05). Ratios revealed higher MD and RD and lower FA and reduced 
      number and length of fibre tracts on the injured side (p<0.05 each). CONCLUSIONS: 
      DTI allowed a robust assessment of muscle tears in athletes especially after 
      normalization to healthy muscle tissue. KEY POINTS: • STEAM-based DTI allows the 
      investigation of muscle tears affecting professional football players. • 
      Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity differ between injured and healthy 
      muscle areas. • Only normalized data show differences of fibre tracking metrics 
      in muscle tears. • The normalization of DTI-metrics enables a more robust 
      characterization of muscle tears.

TI  - Human soleus muscle architecture at different ankle joint angles from magnetic 
      resonance diffusion tensor imaging.
PG  - 807-19
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00923.2010 [doi]
AB  - The orientation of muscle fibers influences the physiological cross-sectional 
      area, the relationship between fiber shortening and aponeurosis shear, and the 
      total force produced by the muscle. Such architectural parameters are challenging 
      to determine particularly in vivo in multicompartment structures such as the 
      human soleus with a complex arrangement of muscle fibers. The objective of this 
      study was to map the fiber architecture of the human soleus in vivo at rest in 
      both neutral and plantarflexed ankle positions using an MRI-based method of 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Six subjects were imaged at 3 Tesla with the foot 
      at rest in the two ankle positions. Eigenvalues, fractional anisotropy (FA), and 
      eigenvector orientations of fibers in the different soleus subcompartments were 
      evaluated after denoising of the diffusion tensor. The fiber architecture from 
      DTI was similar to earlier studies based on a 3D fiber model from cadavers. The 
      three eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor increased by ∼14% on increasing the 
      joint plantarflexion angle in all of the soleus subcompartments, whereas FA 
      showed a trend to decrease in the posterior and marginal soleus and to increase 
      in the anterior soleus. The angle change in the lead eigenvector between the two 
      foot positions was significant: ∼41° for the posterior soleus and ∼48° for the 
      anterior soleus. Fibers tracked from the subcompartments support these changes 
      seen in the eigenvector orientations. DTI-derived, subject-specific, muscle 
      morphological data could potentially be used to model a more complete description 
      of muscle performance and changes from disease.

TI  - Diffusion coefficients of ATP and creatine phosphate in isolated muscle: pulsed 
      gradient 31P NMR of small biological samples.
PG  - 72-8
AB  - Measurements of the intracellular diffusion coefficients (Di) of ATP and creatine 
      phosphate (PCr) in stable, isolated preparations of skeletal muscle were made by 
      means of pulsed field gradient (PFG) 31P NMR. Experiments used a PFG NMR probe 
      specifically designed for small, superfused biological samples. This provided a 
      magnetic field gradient in the z axis of up to 195 G/cm with minimal eddy 
      currents. DiATP and DiPCr in white (fast, glycolytic) skeletal muscle from 
      goldfish (Carassius auratus) were determined to be 2.48 +/- 0.33 and 3.49 +/- 
      0.33 x 10(-6) cm2/s, respectively, at 25 degrees C and a diffusion time of 
      approximately 19 ms. For comparison with Di values, diffusion coefficients of ATP 
      and PCr also were measured in solutions of ionic composition similar to that of 
      fish muscle cytosol. The in vitro diffusion coefficients of ATP and PCr were 3.54 
      +/- 0.11 and 5.28 +/- 0.08 x 10(-6) cm2/s, respectively, at 25 degrees C.

TI  - Weighted Mean of Signal Intensity for Unbiased Fiber Tracking of Skeletal 
      Muscles: Development of a New Method and Comparison With Other Correction 
      Techniques.
PG  - 488-497
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000364 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the origin of random image 
      artifacts in stimulated echo acquisition mode diffusion tensor imaging 
      (STEAM-DTI), assess the role of averaging, develop an automated artifact 
      postprocessing correction method using weighted mean of signal intensities 
      (WMSIs), and compare it with other correction techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. 
      The right calf and thigh of 10 volunteers were scanned on a 3 T magnetic 
      resonance imaging scanner using a STEAM-DTI sequence.Artifacts (ie, signal loss) 
      in STEAM-based DTI, presumably caused by involuntary muscle contractions, were 
      investigated in volunteers and ex vivo (ie, human cadaver calf and turkey leg 
      using the same DTI parameters as for the volunteers). An automated postprocessing 
      artifact correction method based on the WMSI was developed and compared with 
      previous approaches (ie, iteratively reweighted linear least squares and informed 
      robust estimation of tensors by outlier rejection [iRESTORE]). Diffusion tensor 
      imaging and fiber tracking metrics, using different averages and artifact 
      corrections, were compared for region of interest- and mask-based analyses. 
      One-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Greenhouse-Geisser correction 
      and Bonferroni post hoc tests were used to evaluate differences among all tested 
      conditions. Qualitative assessment (ie, images quality) for native and corrected 
      images was performed using the paired t test. RESULTS: Randomly localized and 
      shaped artifacts affected all volunteer data sets. Artifact burden during 
      voluntary muscle contractions increased on average from 23.1% to 77.5% but were 
      absent ex vivo. Diffusion tensor imaging metrics (mean diffusivity, fractional 
      anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity) had a heterogeneous 
      behavior, but in the range reported by literature. Fiber track metrics (number, 
      length, and volume) significantly improved in both calves and thighs after 
      artifact correction in region of interest- and mask-based analyses (P < 0.05 
      each). Iteratively reweighted linear least squares and iRESTORE showed equivalent 
      results, but WMSI was faster than iRESTORE. Muscle delineation and artifact load 
      significantly improved after correction (P < 0.05 each). CONCLUSIONS: Weighted 
      mean of signal intensity correction significantly improved STEAM-based 
      quantitative DTI analyses and fiber tracking of lower-limb muscles, providing a 
      robust tool for musculoskeletal applications.

TI  - Field gradient CPMG applied on postmortem muscles.
PG  - 557-63
AB  - As a new approach, Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) experiments were performed in 
      vitro on porcine muscles (n = 10) during the period from 15 min to 85 min 
      postmortem and again at 24 h postmortem in the absence (G = 0) and the presence 
      of an external field gradient (G = 0.5*10(-3) T/m), which was applied throughout 
      the CPMG sequence. The experiments were performed on low-field nuclear magnetic 
      resonance (NMR) equipment (0.47 T). Due to the inclusion of different 
      pre-slaughter treatments (adrenaline treatment and pre-slaughter 
      exercise/electrical stunning), the muscles could be divided into (I) a group (n = 
      5) characterized by a reduced decrease in pH postmortem and a high water-holding 
      capacity and (II) a group (n = 5) characterized by an increased rate of pH 
      decrease postmortem and a low water-holding capacity. Distributed analysis of the 
      CPMG data revealed two major relaxation populations with relaxation times about 
      30-40 and 200-500 ms, respectively, and comparison of data obtained with G = 0 
      and G = 0.5*10(-3) T/m revealed effects of the external gradient on the 
      relaxation time of both the two relaxation populations, which implies that both 
      diffusion and relaxation contributes to the relaxation of the two populations. At 
      24 h postmortem the effect of the external field gradient on the relaxation time 
      was significantly affected by muscle group (I vs. II), which reveals local 
      differences in water diffusion in the two meat qualities. Finally, the 
      discriminatory power with regard to muscle group (I vs. II) was investigated for 
      data acquired with G = 0 and G = F = 0.5*10(-3) T/m, and both the two types of 
      data were found highly suitable for separation of muscles according to meat 
      quality.

AB  - Understanding the levator ani complex architecture is of major clinical 
      relevance. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of magnetic 
      resonance (MR) fiber tractography with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a tool 
      for the three-dimensional (3D) representation of normal subdivisions of the 
      levator ani. Ten young nulliparous female volunteers underwent DTI at 1.5 T MR 
      imaging. Diffusion-weighted axial sequence of the pelvic floor was performed with 
      additional T2-weighted multiplanar sequences for anatomical reference. Fiber 
      tractography for visualization of each Terminologia Anatomica-listed major 
      levator ani subdivision was performed. Numeric muscular fibers extracted after 
      tractography were judged as accurate when localized within the boundaries of the 
      muscle, and inaccurate when projecting out of the boundaries of the muscle. From 
      the fiber tracking of each subdivision the number of numeric fibers (inaccurate 
      and accurate) and a score (from 3 to 0) of the adequacy of the 3D representation 
      were calculated. All but two volunteers completed the protocol. The mean number 
      of accurate fibers was 17 ± 2 for the pubovisceralis, 14 ± 6 for the puborectalis 
      and 1 ± 1 for the iliococcygeus. The quality of the 3D representation was judged 
      as good (score = 2) for the pubovisceralis and puborectalis, and inaccurate 
      (score = 0) for the iliococcygeus. Our study is the first step to a 3D 
      visualization of the three major levator ani subdivisions, which could help to 
      better understand their in vivo functional anatomy.

AB  - To evaluate the effects of cooling between exercise sessions on intramuscular 
      water movement and muscle performance, the lower extremities of nine untrained 
      men were assigned to either a cooling protocol (20-min water immersion, 15 °C) or 
      a noncooling protocol. Each subject performed two exercise sessions involving 
      maximal concentric knee extension and flexion (three repetitions, 60°/s; followed 
      by 50 repetitions, 180°/s). The peak torque at 60°/s and total work, mean power, 
      and decrease rate of torque value at 180°/s were evaluated. Axial magnetic 
      resonance diffusion-weighted images of the mid-thigh were obtained before and 
      after each exercise session. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values for the 
      quadriceps and hamstrings were calculated for evaluating intramuscular water 
      movement. Both groups exhibited significantly increased ADC values for the 
      quadriceps and hamstrings after each exercise session. These ADC values returned 
      to the pre-exercise level after water immersion. No significant difference was 
      observed in muscle performance from first exercise session to the next in either 
      group, except for increased total work and mean power in knee flexion in the 
      cooled group. Cooling intervention between exercise sessions decreased 
      exercise-induced elevation of intramuscular water movement and had some 
      beneficial effects on muscle endurance of knee flexors, but not knee extensors.

TI  - In vivo model of muscle pain: quantification of intramuscular chemical, 
      electrical, and pressure changes associated with saline-induced muscle pain in 
      humans.
PG  - 137-43
AB  - Intramuscular injection of hypertonic saline is a good model to study human 
      muscle pain (Kellgren 1938). The present study concerns the intramuscular (i.m.) 
      pain mediators in saline-induced muscle pain. In experiment 1, the diffusion of 
      infused hypertonic and isotonic saline (0.5 ml) in m. tibialis anterior was 
      illustrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in one subject. In experiment 2, 
      six volunteers received four sequential infusions (0.5 ml given at 5 min 
      intervals) of isotonic saline and thereafter four sequential infusions (0.5 ml 
      given at 5 min intervals) of hypertonic saline into m. tibialis anterior. The 
      isotonic and hypertonic saline infusions were computer-controlled and separated 
      by 20 min. The muscle pain intensity was assessed by continuous recordings on a 
      visual analogue scale (VAS). One microdialysis probe was inserted 1 cm from the 
      infusion needle in m. tibialis anterior and another probe in the other m. 
      tibialis anterior. Concentrations of the i.m. sodium, potassium, magnesium, and 
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were assessed from the dialysates. Intramuscular 
      electromyography (EMG) and pressure were assessed in the area of the infused 
      saline. In experiment 1, the infusion of hypertonic and isotonic saline created a 
      visible saline-pool on the MRI scans. These saline-pool volumes were stable and 
      not correlated to the pain scores. In experiment 2, infusion of isotonic saline 
      produced little pain compared to infusion of hypertonic saline. Maximal pain was 
      reported after the first infusion of hypertonic saline and thereafter the pain 
      gradually decreased with subsequent infusions of hypertonic saline. During 
      infusion of hypertonic saline the i.m. sodium and potassium concentrations 
      increased significantly, i.m. magnesium concentration tended to be increased, and 
      the i.m. PGE2 concentration tended to be decreased although these changes were 
      not significant. The i.m. EMG was smaller during and after infusions of 
      hypertonic saline compared with isotonic saline. The i.m. pressure was not 
      different during the infusions of hypertonic and isotonic saline but was 
      increased between the infusions of hypertonic saline. This study has shown that 
      i.m. infusion of hypertonic saline produced a saline-pool, causing the i.m. 
      pressure to increase. Possibly, pain activation and cessation are related to 
      increased intramuscular sodium and potassium content respectively.

TI  - Mixed endometrial stromal and smooth muscle tumor of the uterus in a 
      postmenopausal woman: morphologic and immunohistochemical features.
PG  - 319-322
AB  - Mixed endometrial stromal and smooth muscle tumor of the uterus is a rare 
      occurrence, and it is truly challenging to diagnose or dif- ferentiate 
      mesenchymal tumors of the uterine corpus, due to their many overlapping features. 
      In most cases, the gross pathology of mixed endometrial stromal and smooth muscle 
      tumor differs from that of pure endometrial stromal and pure smooth muscle 
      tumors. A 59-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with vaginal spotting, low 
      abdominal pain, and an uterine mass. Subsequent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging 
      revealed a 4.0x3.8x3.4-cm sized uterine mass with enhancement. The mass showed 
      restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted images, and thus, was suspected to be 
      uterine sarcoma rather than degenerative leiomyoma. Levels of tumor markers, CA 
      125, CA 19-9, and SCC, were within their normal ranges. The patient underwent 
      exploratory laparotomy. Morphological and immunohistochemical evaluations were 
      performed, and a final diagnosis of mixed endometrial stromal and smooth muscle 
      tumor of the uterus was rendered. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and 
      aromatase inhibitor adjuvant therapy was administered.

TI  - Water exchange induced by unilateral exercise in active and inactive skeletal 
      muscles.
PG  - 1716-22
AB  - Water exchange was evaluated in active (E-leg) and inactive skeletal muscles by 
      using (1)H-magnetic resonance imaging. Six healthy subjects performed one-legged 
      plantar flexion exercise at low and high workloads. Magnetic resonance imaging 
      measured calf cross-sectional area (CSA), transverse relaxation time (T2), and 
      apparent diffusion capacity (ADC) at rest and during recovery. After high 
      workload, inactive muscle decreased CSA and T2 by 2.1% (P < 0.05) and 3.1% (P < 
      0.05), respectively, and left ADC unchanged. E-leg simultaneously increased CSA, 
      T2, and ADC by 4.2% (P < 0.001), 15.5% (P < 0.05), and 12.5% (P < 0.001), 
      respectively. In conclusion, ADC and T2 correlated highly with muscle volume, 
      indicative of extravascular water displacement closely related to muscle activity 
      and perfusion, which was presumably a combined effect of increased intracellular 
      osmoles and hydrostatic forces as driving forces. A distinguishable muscle 
      temperature release was initially detected in the E-leg after high workload, and 
      the ensuing recovery of ADC and T2 indicated delayed interstitial restitution 
      than restitution of the intracellular compartment. Furthermore, absorption of 
      extravascular water was detected in inactive muscles at contralateral 
      high-intensity exercise.

TI  - [Usefulness of diffusion-weighted MRI in differentiating benign from malignant 
      musculoskeletal tumors].
PG  - 30-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the usefulness of diffusion-weighted MRI in distinguishing 
      different components and in differentiating benign from malignant musculoskeletal 
      tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with musculoskeletal tumors 
      underwent MR at our institution from October 1999 to April 2002. We evaluated 57 
      tumors (9 bone tumors and 48 soft tissue tumors). All tumors were classified into 
      8 groups (myxomatous, fibrous, cystic, cartilaginous, fatty components, 
      hematomas, other benign tumors, and other malignant tumors). MR examinations were 
      performed with a 1.5-Tesla system. Diffusion-weighted single-shot EPI images were 
      obtained in all patients. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were calculated 
      by using b factors of 0 and 1,000 sec/mm2. RESULTS: ADC values of myxomatous, 
      cystic, and cartilaginous components were significantly higher than those of 
      other tumors. In cartilaginous tumors, malignant tumor ADC values (2.33 +/- 0.44) 
      were higher than those of benign tumors (2.13 +/- 0.13). However, there was no 
      significant difference between benign and malignant tumors. Except for 
      high-intensity components on T1-weighted imaging and low or homogeneously very 
      high intensity components on T2-weighted imaging, there was a significant 
      difference in ADC between malignant (1.35 +/- 0.40) and benign (1.97 +/- 0.50) 
      tumors. CONCLUSION: Within the limited number of cases, there was a significant 
      difference in ADC between malignant and benign tumors.

TI  - Dimerization of native myosin LC2(RLC)-free subfragment 1 from adult rabbit 
      skeletal muscle.
PG  - 15129-36
AB  - We reinvestigated whether the native myosin LC2-free-subfragment 1 (S1) dimer 
      exists by using viscometry, capillary electrophoresis, and laser light 
      scattering. We found that the intrinsic viscosity of the monomer is [eta]m = 6.7 
      cm3/g and its translation diffusion coefficient is (c = 0) = 4.43 x 10(-)7 cm2/s. 
      For the dimer, [eta]d = 19.8 cm3/g and (c = 0) = 2.54 x 10(-)7 cm2/s. Using the 
      Svedberg equation and introducing the values of the sedimentation coefficients 
      (5.05 S for the monomer and 6.05 S for the dimer), we find the following 
      molecular weights: Mr,m = 108 000 Da and Mr,d = 213 000 Da, which agree well with 
      previous determinations. Capillary electrophoresis successfully separated S1(A1) 
      and S1(A2), in a monomer buffer, and S1(A1) and S1(A2) and a heterodimer 
      S1(A1)-S1(A2), in a dimer buffer. An interesting feature of the monomer-dimer 
      equilibrium is the presence of temperature transitions, whose positions and 
      widths depend upon the buffer conditions. At low temperatures, a pure dimer was 
      observed, whereas at high temperatures only the monomer was present. The 
      dimerization site on both myosin and S1 is extremely labile.

TI  - 1H- and 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance studies of l-lactate transport in isolated 
      muscle fibers from the spiny lobster Panulirus argus.
PG  - 2225-34
AB  - Proton (1H) and phosphorus (31P) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy 
      were used to investigate the mode of transport of l-lactate across the plasma 
      membranes of the abdominal extensor muscles of the spiny lobster Panulirus argus. 
      Individual fibers or bundles of 2&shy;3 fibers were superfused in a dual-tuned 
      (1H, 31P) microsolenoid NMR probe. 1H-NMR spectra were diffusion-weighted, which 
      eliminated the signal contribution of the fast-flowing extracellular lactate but 
      retained that of intracellular lactate. Well-resolved intracellular lactate 
      signals could be acquired at 15 s intervals, permitting estimation of initial 
      velocities (Vi) of influx and efflux during loading/unloading of muscle fibers. 
      31P-NMR spectra were acquired to assess cellular energy status and intracellular 
      pH. Transport results showed that Vi values for influx and efflux were a linear 
      function of total lactate concentration, displaying no saturation effects. The 
      rate of lactate influx was enhanced by increasing the concentration of the free 
      acid by altering the superfusate pH. Vi values for influx and efflux of d- and 
      l-lactate were identical. Finally, traditional inhibitors of monocarboxylate 
      and/or anion transport had no effect on influx/efflux of lactate from these 
      cells. The above results strongly suggest that the primary mode of lactate 
      transport is by passive diffusion. These cells appear to lack a monocarboxylate 
      transporter, which may be related to the apparent absence of organ-specific 
      compartmentation of lactate metabolism in crustaceans.

AB  - Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders 
      present at birth with muscle weakness, hypotonia and contractures. Congenital 
      muscular dystrophy (CMD) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders with muscle 
      weakness, hypotonia and contractures present at birth. A particular subset of 
      classic CMD is characterized by a complete absence of merosin. Merosin-deficient 
      congenital muscular dystrophy (MDCMD) is a rare genetic disease involving the 
      central and peripheral nervous system in the childhood. High signal intensities 
      are often observed throughout the centrum semiovale, periventricular, and 
      sub-cortical white matters on T2-weighted images in MRI brain in children with 
      MDCMD. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map may reveal increased signal 
      intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient values in the periventricular and 
      deep white matters. These white matter findings, observed in late infancy, 
      decrease in severity with age. The pathogenesis of these changes remains 
      uncertain at present. In this article, we outline the specific MR imaging 
      findings seen in a patient with documented MDCMD and also suggest the causes.

TI  - Determining skeletal muscle architecture with Laplacian simulations: a comparison 
      with diffusion tensor imaging.
PG  - 1845-1855
LID - 10.1007/s10237-017-0923-5 [doi]
AB  - Determination of skeletal muscle architecture is important for accurately 
      modeling muscle behavior. Current methods for 3D muscle architecture 
      determination can be costly and time-consuming, making them prohibitive for 
      clinical or modeling applications. Computational approaches such as Laplacian 
      flow simulations can estimate muscle fascicle orientation based on muscle shape 
      and aponeurosis location. The accuracy of this approach is unknown, however, 
      since it has not been validated against other standards for muscle architecture 
      determination. In this study, muscle architectures from the Laplacian approach 
      were compared to those determined from diffusion tensor imaging in eight adult 
      medial gastrocnemius muscles. The datasets were subdivided into training and 
      validation sets, and computational fluid dynamics software was used to conduct 
      Laplacian simulations. In training sets, inputs of muscle geometry, aponeurosis 
      location, and geometric flow guides resulted in good agreement between methods. 
      Application of the method to validation sets showed no significant differences in 
      pennation angle (mean difference [Formula: see text] or fascicle length (mean 
      difference 0.9 mm). Laplacian simulation was thus effective at predicting 
      gastrocnemius muscle architectures in healthy volunteers using imaging-derived 
      muscle shape and aponeurosis locations. This method may serve as a tool for 
      determining muscle architecture in silico and as a complement to other 
      approaches.

TI  - Nuclear magnetic resonance measurement of skeletal muscle: anisotrophy of the 
      diffusion coefficient of the intracellular water.
PG  - 1043-53
AB  - The anisotropy of the spin-diffusion coefficient Ds of water protons in skeletal 
      muscle has been studied by pulsed NMR methods. The mid-portion of the tibialis 
      anterior muscle of mature male rats was placed in a special sample holder by 
      means of which the muscle fiber orientation theta relative to the diffusion 
      direction could be varied over the range 0 degrees less than or equal to theta 
      less than or equal to 90 degrees. The value of Ds(theta) was determined for theta 
      = 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees. The measured anisotropy Ds(0)/Ds(90) was 
      1.39, and the value of Ds(0) was 1.39 X 10(-5) cm2/s. These results are 
      interpreted within the framework of a model calculation in which the diffusion 
      equation is solved for a regular hexagonal network similar to the actin-myosin 
      filament network. The large anisotropy, and the large reduction in the value of 
      Ds measured parallel to the filament axes lead to two major conclusions: (a) 
      interpretations in which the reduction in Ds is ascribed to the effect of 
      geometrical obstructions on the diffusion of "free" water are ruled out; and, (b) 
      there is a large fraction of the cellular water associated with the proteins in 
      such a way that its diffusion coefficient is substantially reduced.

AB  - Skeletal muscles are highly organized hierarchical structures characterized by an 
      anisotropic arrangement of muscle fibers (myocytes) in fascicles. Due to its 
      unique non-invasive microstructure probing capabilities, diffusion-weighted 
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) constitutes a valuable non-invasive tool in 
      the study of such fibrous biological tissues. We have implemented a DW-MRI 
      sequence with highly sensitive directional encoding to quantify the 
      microarchitectural properties of human calf muscles at rest. We have specifically 
      focused on a composite model-based analysis of diffusion tensor MRI measurements 
      to quantify in vivo the cross-sectional asymmetry of muscle fiber geometry, which 
      is a microstructural feature well documented in prior histological studies.

TI  - Automated segmentation of the quadratus lumborum muscle from magnetic resonance

PG  - 867-70
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649291 [doi]
AB  - This study presents a novel method for the automatic segmentation of the 
      quadratus lumborum (QL) muscle from axial magnetic resonance (MR) images using a 
      hybrid scheme incorporating the use of non-rigid registration with probabilistic 
      atlases (PAs) and geodesic active contours (GACs). The scheme was evaluated on an 
      MR database of 7mm axial images of the lumbar spine from 20 subjects (fast 
      bowlers and athletic controls). This scheme involved several steps, including (i) 
      image pre-processing, (ii) generation of PAs for the QL, psoas (PS) and erector 
      spinae+multifidus (ES+MT) muscles and (iii) segmentation, using 3D GACs 
      initialized and constrained by the propagation of the PAs using non-rigid 
      registration. Pre-processing of the images involved bias field correction based 
      on local entropy minimization with a bicubic spline model and a reverse diffusion 
      interpolation algorithm to increase the slice resolution to 0.98 x 0.98 x 1.75mm. 
      The processed images were then registered (affine and non-rigid) and used to 
      generate an average atlas. The PAs for the QL, PS and ES+MT were then generated 
      by propagation of manual segmentations. These atlases were further analysed with 
      specialised filtering to constrain the QL segmentation from adjacent non-muscle 
      tissues (kidney, fat). This information was then used in 3D GACs to obtain the 
      final segmentation of the QL. The automatic segmentation results were compared 
      with the manual segmentations using the Dice similarity metric (DSC), with a 
      median DSC for the right and left QL muscles of 0.78 (mean = 0.77, sd=0.07) and 
      0.75 (mean =0.74, sd=0.07), respectively.

TI  - Volume illustration of muscle from diffusion tensor images.
PG  - 1425-32
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2009.203 [doi]
AB  - Medical illustration has demonstrated its effectiveness to depict salient 
      anatomical features while hiding the irrelevant details. Current solutions are 
      ineffective for visualizing fibrous structures such as muscle, because typical 
      datasets (CT or MRI) do not contain directional details. In this paper, we 
      introduce a new muscle illustration approach that leverages diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) data and example-based texture synthesis techniques. Beginning with 
      a volumetric diffusion tensor image, we reformulate it into a scalar field and an 
      auxiliary guidance vector field to represent the structure and orientation of a 
      muscle bundle. A muscle mask derived from the input diffusion tensor image is 
      used to classify the muscle structure. The guidance vector field is further 
      refined to remove noise and clarify structure. To simulate the internal 
      appearance of the muscle, we propose a new two-dimensional example based solid 
      texture synthesis algorithm that builds a solid texture constrained by the 
      guidance vector field. Illustrating the constructed scalar field and solid 
      texture efficiently highlights the global appearance of the muscle as well as the 
      local shape and structure of the muscle fibers in an illustrative fashion. We 
      have applied the proposed approach to five example datasets (four pig hearts and 
      a pig leg), demonstrating plausible illustration and expressiveness.

TI  - Hit the mark with diffusion-weighted imaging: metastases of rhabdomyosarcoma to 
      the extraocular eye muscles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most frequent malignant intraorbital tumour 
      in paediatric patients. Differentiation of tumour recurrence or metastases from 
      post-therapeutic signal alteration can be challenging, using standard MR imaging 
      techniques. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is increasingly considered a helpful 
      supplementary imaging tool for differentiation of orbital masses. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: We report on a 15-year-old female adolescent of Caucasian ethnicity 
      who developed isolated bilateral thickening of extraocular eye muscles about two 
      years after successful multimodal treatment of orbital alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. 
      Intramuscular restricted diffusion was the first diagnostic indicator suggestive 
      of metastatic disease to the eye muscles. DWI subsequently showed signal changes 
      consistent with tumour progression, complete remission under chemoradiotherapy 
      and tumour recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Restricted diffusivity is a strong early 
      indicator of malignancy in orbital tumours. DWI can be the key to correct 
      diagnosis in unusual tumour manifestations and can provide additional diagnostic 
      information beyond standard MRI and PET/CT. Diffusion-weighted MRI is useful for 
      monitoring therapy response and for detecting tumour recurrence.

TI  - A novel de novo KIF21A mutation in a patient with congenital fibrosis of the 
      extraocular muscles and Möbius syndrome.
PG  - 368-75
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the phenotypic characteristics and clinical course of a 
      sporadic case of congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM) and 
      Möbius syndrome with a de novo mutation in the KIF21A gene encoding a kinesin 
      motor protein. METHODS: An individual with the rare combination of CFEOM and 
      Möbius syndrome underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic and neurological 
      evaluations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) tractigraphy at 3T field strength was used to evaluate orbital, encephalic, 
      and intracranial nerve integrity. The proband and her healthy parents underwent 
      screening for mutations in the KIF21A, PHOX2A, and TUBB3 genes. RESULTS: The 
      patient exhibited congenital, nonprogressive, bilateral external ophthalmoplegia, 
      bilateral ptosis, bilateral facial palsy, and developmental delay. Her inability 
      to blink resulted in severe exposure keratopathy and subsequent corneal 
      perforation requiring a penetrating keratoplasty. MRI revealed an unremarkable 
      configuration of the axial central nervous system and preservation of the 
      intracranial portion of cranial nerves I, II, III, V, VI, VII, and VIII (cranial 
      nerve IV is not normally visualized by MRI). A novel and de novo heterozygous 
      KIF21A mutation (c.1056C>G, p.Asp352Glu) in a highly conserved region of the gene 
      was present in the proband. CONCLUSIONS: The reported KIF21A D352E mutation and 
      associated phenotype further expand the clinical and mutational spectrum of CFEOM 
      and Möbius syndrome.

TI  - Combined effect of Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 and HMB supplementation on 
      muscle integrity and cytokine response during intense military training.
PG  - 11-18
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.01116.2016 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the coadministration of the probiotic 
      Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 (BC30) with β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) 
      calcium (CaHMB) to CaHMB alone on inflammatory response and muscle integrity 
      during 40 days of intense military training. Soldiers were randomly assigned to 
      one of two groups: CaHMB with BC30 (CaHMBBC30; n = 9) or CaHMB with placebo 
      (CaHMBPL, n = 9). A third group of participants served as a control (CTL; n = 8). 
      During the first 28 days soldiers were garrisoned on base and participated in the 
      same training tasks. During the final 2 wk soldiers navigated 25-30 km per night 
      in difficult terrain carrying ~35 kg of equipment. All assessments (blood draws 
      and diffusion tensor imaging to assess muscle integrity) were conducted before 
      and ~12 h after final supplement consumption. Analysis of covariance was used to 
      analyze all blood and muscle measures. Significant attenuations were noted in 
      IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, CX3CL1, and TNF-α for both CaHMBBC30 and CaHMBPL compared with 
      CTL. Plasma IL-10 concentrations were significantly attenuated for CaHMBBC30 
      compared with CTL only. A significant decrease in apparent diffusion coefficients 
      was also observed for CaHMBBC30 compared with CaHMBPL. Results provide further 
      evidence that HMB supplementation may attenuate the inflammatory response to 
      intense training and that the combination of the probiotic BC30 with CaHMB may be 
      more beneficial than CaHMB alone in maintaining muscle integrity during intense 
      military training.NEW & NOTEWORTHY β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) in its free 
      acid form was reported to attenuate inflammation and maintain muscle integrity 
      during military training. However, this formulation was difficult to maintain in 
      the field. In this investigation, soldiers ingested HMB calcium (CaHMB) with 
      Bacillus coagulans (BC30) or CaHMB alone during 40 days of training. Results 
      indicated that CaHMB attenuated the inflammatory response and that BC30 combined 
      with CaHMB may be more beneficial than CaHMB alone in maintaining muscle 
      integrity during intense military training.

TI  - Subject-specific muscle properties from diffusion tensor imaging significantly 
      improve the accuracy of musculoskeletal models.
PG  - 941-959
LID - 10.1111/joa.13261 [doi]
AB  - Musculoskeletal modelling is an important platform on which to study the 
      biomechanics of morphological structures in vertebrates and is widely used in 
      clinical, zoological and palaeontological fields. The popularity of this approach 
      stems from the potential to non-invasively quantify biologically important but 
      difficult-to-measure functional parameters. However, while it is known that model 
      predictions are highly sensitive to input values, it is standard practice to 
      build models by combining musculoskeletal data from different sources resulting 
      in 'generic' models for a given species. At present, there are little 
      quantitative data on how merging disparate anatomical data in models impacts the 
      accuracy of these functional predictions. This issue is addressed herein by 
      quantifying the accuracy of both subject-specific human limb models containing 
      individualised muscle force-generating properties and models built using generic 
      properties from both elderly and young individuals, relative to experimental 
      muscle torques obtained from an isokinetic dynamometer. The results show that 
      subject-specific models predict isokinetic muscle torques to a greater degree of 
      accuracy than generic models at the ankle (root-mean-squared error - 7.9% vs. 
      49.3% in elderly anatomy-based models), knee (13.2% vs. 57.3%) and hip (21.9% vs. 
      32.8%). These results have important implications for the choice of 
      musculoskeletal properties in future modelling studies, and the relatively high 
      level of accuracy achieved in the subject-specific models suggests that such 
      models can potentially address questions about inter-subject variations of muscle 
      functions. However, despite relatively high levels of overall accuracy, models 
      built using averaged generic muscle architecture data from young, healthy 
      individuals may lack the resolution and accuracy required to study such 
      differences between individuals, at least in certain circumstances. The results 
      do not wholly discourage the continued use of averaged generic data in 
      musculoskeletal modelling studies but do emphasise the need for to maximise the 
      accuracy of input values if studying intra-species form-function relationships in 
      the musculoskeletal system.

TI  - Simultaneous Multislice Echo Planar Imaging With Blipped Controlled Aliasing in 
      Parallel Imaging Results in Higher Acceleration: A Promising Technique for 
      Accelerated Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Skeletal Muscle.
PG  - 456-63
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000151 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of 
      accelerated diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of skeletal muscle using echo planar 
      imaging (EPI) applying simultaneous multislice excitation with a blipped 
      controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration unaliasing 
      technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After federal ethics board approval, the lower 
      leg muscles of 8 healthy volunteers (mean [SD] age, 29.4 [2.9] years) were 
      examined in a clinical 3-T magnetic resonance scanner using a 15-channel knee 
      coil. The EPI was performed at a b value of 500 s/mm2 without slice acceleration 
      (conventional DTI) as well as with 2-fold and 3-fold acceleration. Fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were measured in all 3 acquisitions. 
      Fiber tracking performance was compared between the acquisitions regarding the 
      number of tracks, average track length, and anatomical precision using 
      multivariate analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Acquisition 
      time was 7:24 minutes for conventional DTI, 3:53 minutes for 2-fold acceleration, 
      and 2:38 minutes for 3-fold acceleration. Overall FA and MD values ranged from 
      0.220 to 0.378 and 1.595 to 1.829 mm2/s, respectively. Two-fold acceleration 
      yielded similar FA and MD values (P ≥ 0.901) and similar fiber tracking 
      performance compared with conventional DTI. Three-fold acceleration resulted in 
      comparable MD (P = 0.199) but higher FA values (P = 0.006) and significantly 
      impaired fiber tracking in the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles (number of 
      tracks, P < 0.001; anatomical precision, P ≤ 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous 
      multislice EPI with blipped controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in 
      higher acceleration can remarkably reduce acquisition time in DTI of skeletal 
      muscle with similar image quality and quantification accuracy of diffusion 
      parameters. This may increase the clinical applicability of muscle anisotropy 
      measurements.

TI  - Multiple directional DWI combined with T2WI in predicting muscle layer and Ki-67 
      correlation in bladder cancer in 3.0-T MRI.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5782 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of 3.0T MRI multi-directional 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) combined with T2WI morphological features and 
      lesion distribution in preoperative prediction of muscle layer invasion of 
      bladder cancer (BC) and the correlation with postoperative Ki-67. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled patients with BC between 2019 and 
      2021. Patients with muscular invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) or non-muscular 
      invasive BC (NMIBC) were also analyzed by preoperative 3.0T MRI aFostic efficacy. 
      RESULTS: A total of 186 patients were enrolled. About 27 patients with MIBC (35 
      lesions in total) and 62 with NMIBC (99 lesions in total). We found the tumor 
      with a larger size, a wide base, and a smaller apparent dispersion coefficient 
      (ADC) value and normalized ADC(nADC) value, without a stalk, presenting a greater 
      risk of muscle invasion. ADC value, nADC value, maximum diameter, and stalk were 
      independently associated with muscle invasion. Lesions located at the bladder 
      fundus or involvement of multiple sites were independently associated with muscle 
      invasion compared to the bladder body. In combination with morphological 
      features, the AUCs of ADC and nADC showed accuracies of 0.925 and 0.947-0.951, 
      respectively. TADC and nTADC showed the best diagnostic efficacy in multiple 
      respects. KI-67 LI was negatively correlated with ADC and nADC values. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report in which we found Multi-directional DWI 
      combined with T2WI in 3.0T MRI can be used to predict the muscle layer invasion 
      of bladder cancer. ADC values reflect the muscular invasion of bladder cancer and 
      show a moderate negative correlation with Ki-67. It is especially suitable for 
      bladder cancer patients with renal insufficiency or tumor recurrence.

TI  - Large-Scale Evaluation of Major Soluble Macromolecular Components of Fish Muscle 
      from a Conventional (1)H-NMR Spectral Database.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25081966 [doi]
LID - 1966
AB  - Conventional proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) has been widely used 
      for identification and quantification of small molecular components in food. 
      However, identification of major soluble macromolecular components from 
      conventional (1)H-NMR spectra is difficult. This is because the baseline 
      appearance is masked by the dense and high-intensity signals from small molecular 
      components present in the sample mixtures. In this study, we introduced an 
      integrated analytical strategy based on the combination of additional measurement 
      using a diffusion filter, covariation peak separation, and matrix decomposition 
      in a small-scale training dataset. This strategy is aimed to extract signal 
      profiles of soluble macromolecular components from conventional (1)H-NMR spectral 
      data in a large-scale dataset without the requirement of re-measurement. We 
      applied this method to the conventional (1)H-NMR spectra of water-soluble fish 
      muscle extracts and investigated the distribution characteristics of fish 
      diversity and muscle soluble macromolecular components, such as lipids and 
      collagens. We identified a cluster of fish species with low content of lipids and 
      high content of collagens in muscle, which showed great potential for the 
      development of functional foods. Because this mechanical data processing method 
      requires additional measurement of only a small-scale training dataset without 
      special sample pretreatment, it should be immediately applicable to extract 
      macromolecular signals from accumulated conventional (1)H-NMR databases of other 
      complex gelatinous mixtures in foods.

TI  - Volumetric assessment of spontaneous mechanical activities by simultaneous 
      multi-slice MRI techniques with correlation to muscle fiber orientation.
PG  - e3959
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3959 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this work was assessment of volumetric characteristics of 
      spontaneous mechanical activities in musculature (SMAMs) by diffusion-weighted 
      simultaneous multi-slice (DW-SMS) imaging and spatial correlation to anatomical 
      structure, as revealed by fusion to fiber tractographic information derived from 
      diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI). The feasibility of using DW-SMS to image 
      spontaneous events in human musculature was assessed by phantom measurements. 
      Series of DW-SMS images and DTI datasets were recorded from the resting calf of 
      three human subjects. Simultaneously recorded SMAMs in multiple slices were 
      analyzed regarding spatial extension by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Direct 
      correlation of spatial distribution of SMAMs and fiber orientation was 
      investigated by mapping of muscle fibers to multi-slice SMAM datasets. The DW-SMS 
      strategy allows simultaneous assessment of SMAMs in several slices of resting 
      skeletal musculature, since 73.9% of SMAM-affected volumes have shown SMAMs in 
      multiple DW-SMS slices. Spatial extension of SMAMs was highly correlated over 
      different simultaneously recorded DW-SMS slices, and affected areas followed the 
      orientation of muscle fibers with a connectivity ratio up to 57.18 ± 14.80% based 
      on event count and connectivity count maps. In 89.2% of all SMAM-affected 
      datasets muscle fiber connectivity was shown in at least two adjacent slices. 
      Direct correlation between SMAMs in human lower leg musculature and underlying 
      anatomical structure was revealed by high muscle fiber connectivity (89.2%). 
      SMAMs have shown a wide distribution along the longitudinal muscle direction 
      (73.9% in multiple DW-SMS slices) with direct involvement of muscle fibers. 
      Correlation between SMAMs in multiple DW-SMS slices and crossing muscular fiber 
      tracts provides evidence that SMAMs result from physiological processes in 
      musculature. Fusion of DW-SMS with DTI facilitates non-invasive studies of muscle 
      fiber involvement in SMAMs in resting muscle.

PG  - W208-11
LID - 10.2214/AJR.09.3167 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether joint position affects muscle proton diffusion, 
      fractional anisotropy and primary (lambda(1)), secondary (lambda(2)), and 
      tertiary (lambda(3)) eigenvalues of calf muscles were compared among ankle 
      positions of plantar flexion, intermediate, and dorsiflexion. CONCLUSION: In 
      tibialis anterior, fractional anisotropy and lambda(1) decreased, but lambda(2) 
      and lambda(3) increased (p < 0.01) as the joint angle increased. Opposite results 
      were obtained for the gastrocnemius and soleus (p < 0.05). These results indicate 
      that joint position affects muscle proton diffusion.

TI  - Application of intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion imaging to shoulder muscles 
      after a lift-off test of varying duration.
PG  - 66-73
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3449 [doi]
AB  - Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI is a method to extract microvascular 
      blood flow information out of diffusion-weighted images acquired at multiple 
      b-values. We hypothesized that IVIM can identify the muscles selectively involved 
      in a specific task, by measuring changes in activity-induced local muscular 
      perfusion after exercise. We tested this hypothesis using a widely used clinical 
      maneuver, the lift-off test, which is known to assess specifically the 
      subscapularis muscle functional integrity. Twelve shoulders from six healthy male 
      volunteers were imaged at 3 T, at rest, as well as after a lift-off test hold 
      against resistance for 30 s, 1 and 2 min respectively, in three independent 
      sessions. IVIM parameters, consisting of perfusion fraction (f), diffusion 
      coefficient (D), pseudo-diffusion coefficient D* and blood flow-related fD*, were 
      estimated within outlined muscles of the rotator cuff and the deltoid bundles. 
      The mean values at rest and after the lift-off tests were compared in each muscle 
      using a one-way ANOVA. A statistically significant increase in fD* was measured 
      in the subscapularis, after a lift-off test of any duration, as well as in D. A 
      fD* increase was the most marked (30 s, +103%; 1 min, +130%; 2 min, +156%) and 
      was gradual with the duration of the test (in 10(-3) mm(2) /s: rest, 1.41 ± 0.50; 
      30 s, 2.86 ± 1.17; 1 min, 3.23 ± 1.22; 2 min, 3.60 ± 1.21). A significant 
      increase in fD* and D was also visible in the posterior bundle of the deltoid. No 
      significant change was consistently visible in the other investigated muscles of 
      the rotator cuff and the other bundles of the deltoid. In conclusion, IVIM fD* 
      allows the demonstration of a task-related microvascular perfusion increase after 
      a specific task and suggests a direct relationship between microvascular 
      perfusion and the duration of the effort. It is a promising method to investigate 
      non-invasively skeletal muscle physiology and clinical perfusion-related muscular 
      disorders.

AB  - The effect of salt concentration and fibre orientation on water within the meat 
      matrix was investigated by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR), 
      water-binding capacity (WBC), diffusion studies and histological analysis. Pork 
      M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum samples were cured with 5.7, 15.3 or 26.3% 
      w/w NaCl at a parallel or perpendicular fibre direction. NMR transverse (T2) 
      relaxation identified three water components (T2b, T21 and T22) which all 
      exhibited characteristics correlated to WBC. Results indicated that T2b increases 
      with increasing NaCl concentration. Increasing intra-myofibrillar water and 
      decreasing extra-myofibrillar water resulted in the highest WBC. Water diffused 
      more quickly into the extra-myofibrillar space in samples cured at a parallel 
      fibre direction. This water remained loosely bound in samples cured with the 
      saturated solution (26.3% w/w NaCl) leading to decreased WBC. This study provides 
      further information on water binding within the meat matrix by applying the 
      results of LF-NMR to traditional water-binding theories.

AB  - Due to its unique non-invasive microstructure probing capabilities, diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) constitutes a valuable tool in the study of fiber 
      orientation in skeletal muscles. By implementing a DTI sequence with judiciously 
      chosen directional encoding to quantify in vivo the microarchitectural properties 
      in the calf muscles of three healthy volunteers at rest, we report that the 
      secondary eigenvalue is significantly higher than the tertiary eigenvalue, a 
      phenomenon corroborated by prior DTI findings. Toward a physics-based explanation 
      of this phenomenon, we propose a composite medium model that accounts for water 
      diffusion in the space within the muscle fiber and the extracellular space. The 
      muscle fibers are abstracted as cylinders of infinite length with an elliptical 
      cross section, the latter closely approximating microstructural features well 
      documented in prior histological studies of excised muscle. The range of values 
      of fiber ellipticity predicted by our model agrees with these studies, and the 
      spatial orientation of the cross-sectional ellipses is consistent with local 
      muscle strain fields and the putative direction of lateral transmission of stress 
      between fibers in certain regions in three antigravity muscles (Tibialis 
      Anterior, Soleus, and Gastrocnemius), as well as independent measurements of 
      deformation in active calf muscles. As a metric, fiber cross-sectional 
      ellipticity may be useful for quantifying morphological changes in skeletal 
      muscle fibers with aging, hypertrophy, or sarcopenia.

TI  - An interleaved sampling strategy for MR spectroscopy in vivo: applications on 
      human calf musculature.
PG  - 189-97
AB  - Assessment of relaxation times, magnetization transfer rates, or apparent 
      diffusion coefficients by volume selective (1)H MR spectroscopy requires data 
      from several single spectra with variable sequence parameters. Unintentional 
      movements during the examination lead to inaccuracies, especially if the spatial 
      distribution of concentrations is inhomogeneous. Improved comparability of the 
      single spectra in a series recorded in vivo were obtained using a modified 
      spectroscopic technique with INTerleaved ACquisiTion of multiple SPECtra 
      (INTACTSPEC). INTACTSPEC series of spectra from the tibialis anterior muscle (m. 
      tib. ant.), soleus muscle (m. soleus), and tibial bone marrow of 20 healthy 
      volunteers were analyzed. Transverse relaxation times T(2) of methylene signals 
      in muscular lipid stores ranged from 77 ms (intramyocellular methylene component 
      in m. tib. ant.) to 88 ms (intramyocellular methylene component in m. soleus) and 
      were similar to those from yellow tibial bone marrow (T(2) = 84 ms). Echo 
      time-dependent signal intensities of choline and creatine deviated markedly from 
      a monoexponential behavior in m. tib. ant., but were nearly exponential in m. 
      soleus. Results from water diffusion measurements parallel and perpendicular to 
      the axis of the lower leg showed significant differences between m. tib. ant. and 
      m. soleus, probably due to the spatial orientation of the muscle fibers. Apparent 
      diffusion coefficients along the leg axis were found to be higher in m. tib. ant. 
      (2.10 +/- 0.08 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) compared to m. soleus (1.78 +/- 0.11 x 10(-3) 
      mm(2)/s), but m. soleus showed less restricted diffusion in perpendicular 
      orientation (1.59 +/- 0.19 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s versus 1.20 +/- 0.08 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s 
      in m. tib. ant.). Magnetization transfer experiments with various RF preparation 
      pulse amplitudes led to very similar results for m. tib. ant. and m. soleus.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of three-dimensional-resolved fiber architecture in 
      heterogeneous skeletal muscle tissue using nmr and optical imaging methods.
PG  - 2968-75
AB  - The determination of principal fiber directions in structurally heterogeneous 
      biological tissue substantially contributes to an understanding of its mechanical 
      function in vivo. In this study we have depicted structural heterogeneity through 
      the model of the mammalian tongue, a tissue comprised of a network of highly 
      interwoven fibers responsible for producing numerous variations of shape and 
      position. In order to characterize the three-dimensional-resolved microscopic 
      myoarchitecture of the intrinsic musculature of the tongue, we viewed its fiber 
      orientation at microscopic and macroscopic length scales using NMR (diffusion 
      tensor MRI) and optical (two-photon microscopy) imaging methods. Diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) of the excised core region of the porcine tongue resulted in an 
      array of 3D diffusion tensors, in which the leading eigenvector corresponded to 
      the principal fiber orientation at each location in the tissue. Excised axially 
      oriented lingual core tissues (fresh or paraffin-embedded) were also imaged with 
      a mode-locked Ti-Sapphire laser, (76 MHz repetition rate, 150 femtosecond pulse 
      width), allowing for the visualization of individual myofibers at in situ 
      orientation. Fiber orientation was assessed by computing the 3D autocorrelation 
      of discrete image volumes, and deriving the minimal eigenvector of the center 
      voxel Hessian matrix. DTI of the fibers, comprising the intrinsic core of the 
      tongue, demonstrated directional heterogeneity, with two distinct populations of 
      fibers oriented orthogonal to each other and in-plane to the axial perspective. 
      Microscopic analysis defined this structural heterogeneity as discrete regions of 
      in-plane parallel fibers, with an angular separation of ~80 degrees, thereby 
      recapitulating the macroscopic angular relationship. This analysis, conceived at 
      two different length scales, demonstrates that the lingual core is a spatially 
      complex tissue, composed of repeating orthogonally oriented and in-plane fiber 
      patches, which are capable of jointly producing hydrostatic elongation and 
      displacement.

TI  - Effect of passive muscle length change on apparent diffusion coefficient: 
      detection with clinical MR imaging.
PG  - 59-63
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated whether change in muscle microstructure associated with 
      passive extension and contraction affects proton diffusivity. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: In 6 male subjects, we compared apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) 
      along the posterior-to-anterior (ADC-PA), right-to-left (ADC-RL) and 
      superior-to-inferior (ADC-SI) directions of the right tibialis anterior muscle 
      with the ankle joint in passive plantar flexion and passive dorsiflexion. 
      RESULTS: Compared to the respective ADCs at plantar flexion, the ADC-PA (P=0.002) 
      and ADC-RL (P=0.008) were significantly greater, but ADC-SI (P=0.008) 
      significantly lower at dorsiflexion. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that change 
      in muscle microstructure associated with passive extension and contraction would 
      affect proton diffusivity, and this alteration of proton diffusivity could be 
      detected by measuring ADC with a clinical magnetic resonance scanner.

AB  - Here, we report on a boy affected by both cerebral palsy and Becker muscular 
      dystrophy (BMD). He had infrequently used his right hand since birth. But brain 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken at the age of 15 months showed no specific 
      finding. Approximately 1 month later, muscle enzymes of his older brother were 
      incidentally found to be elevated. The patient and his brother were diagnosed 
      with progressive muscular dystrophy by gene analysis. At the age of 6 years, he 
      underwent orthopedic surgery due to a right equinovarus deformity and BMD was 
      confirmed by concomitant muscle biopsy. During the post-operative rehabilitation, 
      clumsiness of the right hand was also observed. A follow-up brain MRI with 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was taken. Although no responsible lesion was 
      found on conventional MRI, DTI and fiber tractography revealed a decrease in the

AB  - Oxidative function during exercise was evaluated in 11 young athletes with marked 
      skeletal muscle hypertrophy induced by long-term resistance training (RTA; body 
      mass 102.6 ± 7.3 kg, mean ± SD) and 11 controls (CTRL; body mass 77.8 ± 6.0 kg). 
      Pulmonary O2 uptake (Vo2) and vastus lateralis muscle fractional O2 extraction 
      (by near-infrared spectroscopy) were determined during an incremental cycle 
      ergometer (CE) and one-leg knee-extension (KE) exercise. Mitochondrial 
      respiration was evaluated ex vivo by high-resolution respirometry in 
      permeabilized vastus lateralis fibers obtained by biopsy. Quadriceps femoris 
      muscle cross-sectional area, volume (determined by magnetic resonance imaging), 
      and strength were greater in RTA vs. CTRL (by ∼40%, ∼33%, and ∼20%, 
      respectively). Vo2peak during CE was higher in RTA vs. CTRL (4.05 ± 0.64 vs. 3.56 
      ± 0.30 l/min); no difference between groups was observed during KE. The O2 cost 
      of CE exercise was not different between groups. When divided per muscle mass 
      (for CE) or quadriceps muscle mass (for KE), Vo2 peak was lower (by 15-20%) in 
      RTA vs. CTRL. Vastus lateralis fractional O2 extraction was lower in RTA vs. CTRL 
      at all work rates, during both CE and KE. RTA had higher ADP-stimulated 
      mitochondrial respiration (56.7 ± 23.7 pmol O2·s(-1)·mg(-1) ww) vs. CTRL (35.7 ± 
      10.2 pmol O2·s(-1)·mg(-1) ww) and a tighter coupling of oxidative 
      phosphorylation. In RTA, the greater muscle mass and maximal force and the 
      enhanced mitochondrial respiration seem to compensate for the hypertrophy-induced 
      impaired peripheral O2 diffusion. The net results are an enhanced whole body 
      oxidative function at peak exercise and unchanged efficiency and O2 cost at 
      submaximal exercise, despite a much greater body mass.

AB  - Skeletal muscle is vulnerable to ischemia injury after direct trauma or indirect 
      causes. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been demonstrated 
      to be a powerful tool to investigate muscle structures. However, most previous 
      DTI studies that investigated ischemia muscle were performed on mature species, 
      results of which may not apply on other age populations, such as young groups. In 
      this study, age-related variation of muscle regeneration course after ischemia 
      injury was investigated for the first time. Ten young and ten mature SD rats were 
      induced ischemia in hindlimbs, and the evolutions of the skeletal muscle 
      regeneration were longitudinally studied using DTI before and till 21 days after 
      surgery. Results showed that the young group was more sensitive to ischemia and 
      recovered more rapidly than the mature one. This study confirms the age-related 
      variation of muscle regeneration process, and may provide supplemental 
      information for better understanding of muscle repair evolution.

      embryo using DTI: feasibility and correlation with histology.
PG  - 38
LID - 10.1186/1471-213X-12-38 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive method of evaluating 
      embryonic development. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), based on the directional 
      diffusivity of water molecules, is an established method of evaluating tissue 
      structure. Yet embryonic motion degrades the in vivo acquisition of long-duration 
      DTI. We used a dual-cooling technique to avoid motion artifact and aimed to 
      investigate whether DTI can be used to monitor chick embryonic skeletal muscle 
      development in ovo, and to investigate the correlation between quantitative DTI 
      parameters fractional anisotropy (FA) and fiber length and quantitative 
      histologic parameters fiber area percentage (FiberArea%) and limb length. 
      RESULTS: From 84 normally developing chick embryos, 5 were randomly chosen each 
      day from incubation days 5 to 18 and scanned using 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance 
      imaging. A dual-cooling technique is used before and during imaging. Eggs were 
      cracked for making histological specimen after imaging. 3 eggs were serially 
      imaged from days 5 to 18. We show that skeletal muscle fibers can be tracked in 
      hind limb in DTI beginning with incubation day 8. Our data shows a good positive 
      correlation between quantitative DTI and histologic parameters (FA vs FiberArea%: 
      r= 0.943, p<0.0001; Fiber_length vs Limb_length: r=0.974, p<0.0001). The result 
      of tracked fibers in DTI during incubation corresponds to the development of 
      chick embryonic skeletal muscle as reported in the literature. CONCLUSION: 
      Diffusion tensor imaging can provide a noninvasive means of evaluating skeletal 
      muscle development in ovo.

TI  - Brain Arteriovenous Malformations Supplied by the Anterior Choroidal Artery: 
      Treatment Outcomes and Risk Factors for Worsened Muscle Strength After Surgical 
      Resection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) supplied by 
      the anterior choroidal artery (AChA), or aBAVMs, remains challenging. The aim of 
      this study was to determine the surgical outcomes and risk factors for worsened 
      muscle strength (MS) after surgery in patients with aBAVMs. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively reviewed 266 consecutive patients with BAVMs who underwent 
      microsurgical resection of their BAVMs between September 2012 and June 2016. 
      Patients were included if the BAVMs were entirely or partially supplied by the 
      AChA. All patients had undergone preoperative diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic 
      resonance imaging, 3-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography, 
      and digital subtraction angiography followed by resection. Both functional and 
      angioarchitectural factors were analyzed with respect to the change in MS. 
      RESULTS: We identified 29 patients with aBAVMs who underwent surgical resection 
      of the nidus. Radical resection was achieved in all patients. Thirteen (44.8%) 
      patients suffered from postoperative short-term and 11 (37.9%) suffered from 
      long-term MS deterioration. A shorter lesion-to-corticospinal tract distance 
      (LCD) (P = 0.004) was significantly associated with postoperative short-term 
      worsened MS. Shorter LCD (P = 0.018) and nidus supplied by cisternal segment of 
      AChA (P = 0.026) were independent risk factors for the long-term MS worsening. 
      The amplitudes and potential changes of intraoperative motor-evoked potential 
      monitoring were consistent with the surgical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical 
      treatment of aBAVMs can cause a high incidence of MS deficits. Niduses supplied 
      by cisternal segment of AChA and shorter LCD were crucial risk factors for 
      postoperative MS worsening. Motor-evoked potential monitoring was an effective 
      intraoperative technique to predict postoperative MS deficits.

AB  - We evaluated, by means of a non-invasive procedure based on MRI, the masticatory 
      muscular microstructure in a 55-year-old-female patient affected by bruxism. The 
      patient underwent MR examination before and after 1 month of splint therapy, when 
      she mentioned the complete disappearance of all symptoms. By means of diffusion 
      tensor imaging we observed changes at microstructural level of masticatory 
      muscular complex. We conclude that diffusion tensor imaging may be a useful 
      instrument both to perform panoramic reconstruction of the masticatory muscle 
      complex and to investigate microstructural modifications related to the pain 
      relief in bruxism.

TI  - Orientation of spin-labeled light chain-2 exchanged onto myosin cross-bridges in 
      glycerinated muscle fibers.
PG  - 127-38
AB  - Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has been used to study the 
      angular distribution of a spin label attached to rabbit skeletal muscle myosin 
      light chain 2. A cysteine reactive spin label, 
      3-(5-fluoro-2,4-dinitroanilino)-2,2,5,5- tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (FDNA-SL) 
      was bound to purified LC2. The labeled LC2 was exchanged into glycerinated muscle 
      fibers and into myosin and its subfragments. Analysis of the spectra of labeled 
      fibers in rigor showed that the probe was oriented with respect to the fiber 
      axis, but that it was also undergoing restricted rotations. The motion of the 
      probe could be modeled assuming rapid rotational diffusion (rotational 
      correlation time faster than 5 ns) within a "cone" whose full width was 70 
      degrees. Very different spectra of rigor fibers were obtained with the fiber 
      oriented parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, showing that the 
      centroid of each cone had the same orientation for all myosin heads, making an 
      angle of approximately 74 degrees to the fiber axis. Binding of light chains or 
      labeled myosin subfragment-1 to ion exchange heads immobilized the probes, 
      showing that most of the motion of the probe arose from protein mobility and not 
      from mobility of the probe relative to the protein. Relaxed labeled fibers 
      produced EPR spectra with a highly disordered angular distribution, consistent 
      with myosin heads being detached from the thin filament and undergoing large 
      angular motions. Addition of pyrophosphate, ADP, or an ATP analogue (AMPPNP), in 
      low ionic strength buffer where these ligands do not dissociate cross-bridges 
      from actin, failed to perturb the rigor spectrum. Applying static strains as high 
      as 0.16 N/mm2 to the labeled rigor fibers also failed to change the orientation 
      of the spin label. Labeled light chain was exchanged into myosin subfragment-1 
      (S1) and the labeled S1 was diffused into fibers. EPR spectra of these fibers had 
      a component similar to that seen in the spectra of fibers into which labeled LC2 
      had been exchanged directly. However, the fraction of disordered probes was 
      greater than seen in fibers. In summary, the above data indicate that the region 
      of the myosin head proximal to the thick filament is ordered in rigor, and 
      disordered in relaxation.

TI  - A Rare Case of Idiopathic Temporal Muscle Abscess in a Nine-month-old Infant.
PG  - 2699-2702
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.2727-19 [doi]
AB  - Temporal muscle abscess in children usually occurs from acute otitis media, and 
      rapid progression and concomitant infectious disease often make it easy to 
      diagnose. We report a rare case of a nine-month-old infant who showed right 
      temporal mass with no evidence of infection. Computed tomography showed an 
      osteolytic round mass, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed heterogenous 
      enhancement with a high apparent diffusion coefficient. Malignant tumor was first 
      suspected, but an open biopsy revealed the swelling to be temporal muscle 
      abscess. It should be noted that temporal abscess may mimic the features of a 
      malignant tumor, and multiple examinations should be performed for an accurate 
      diagnosis.

TI  - Determinants of diurnal variation in lumbar intervertebral discs and paraspinal

LID - 10.1016/j.ejrad.2023.110712 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To prospectively investigate the determinants of diurnal variations in 
      lumbar intervertebral discs and paraspinal muscles. METHOD: 71 females aged 
      19 ∼ 31 years were examined by morning-evening T2 mapping/diffusion kurtosis 
      imaging (DKI), with weight and lifestyle information (time in night bed-rest 
      [TIB], bed-napping, activity time, and sitting time) assessed by standardized 
      questionnaires. Diurnal shifts in T2, mean diffusivity and mean kurtosis (T2-DS, 
      MD-DS and MK-DS; morning-value minus evening-value) were evaluated for L4-S1 
      discs (normal, Pfirrmann grade Ⅰ/Ⅱ; degenerative, III/IV). T2 and T2-DS were 
      assessed for L4/5 multifidus and erector spinalis. RESULTS: For normal discs, 
      bed-napping correlated with MD-DS and MK-DS in disc entirety (p = 0.001 and 
      0.004); increased activity time suggested higher T2-DS in nucleus pulposus 
      (p = 0.004); prolonged sitting time predicted greater T2-DS in disc entirety and 
      posterior inner annulus fibrosus (PI-AF, p ≤ 0.011); decreased TIB and weight 
      suggested lower T2-DS and higher MK-DS in PI-AF (p = 0.001 ∼ 0.035). For 
      degenerative discs, bed-napping predicted lower T2-DS in nucleus pulposus and 
      PI-AF (p = 0.019); increased TIBsuggested higher T2-DS and lower MK-DS in PI-AF 
      (p = 0.006 and 0.034); longer sitting time predicted higher MK-DS in PI-AF 
      (p = 0.020). Paraspinal muscles exhibited diurnal T2 variation (p < 0.001) which 
      did not correlate with lifestyle factors (p > 0.050). CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle and 
      weight have causal effects on the diurnal variation of lumbar discs. Bed-rest may 
      correlate with disc hydration and microstructural stability reserves for 
      subsequent daytime activities. Sitting behavior could induce greater dehydration 
      in normal discs and may alleviate diurnal microstructural rearrangement in 
      degenerative discs. T2 mapping and DKI are promising tools to evaluate disc 
      biomechanics in clinics.

TI  - NMR evidence for complexing of Na+ in muscle, kidney, and brain, and by 
      actomyosin. The relation of cellular complexing of Na+ to water structure and to 
      transport kinetics.
PG  - 1353-75
AB  - The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of Na(+) is suitable for 
      qualitative and quantitative analysis of Na(+) in tissues. The width of the NMR 
      spectrum is dependent upon the environment surrounding the individual Na(+) ion. 
      NMR spectra of fresh muscle compared with spectra of the same samples after 
      ashing show that approximately 70% of total muscle Na(+) gives no detectable NMR 
      spectrum. This is probably due to complexation of Na(+) with macromolecules, 
      which causes the NMR spectrum to be broadened beyond detection. A similar effect 
      has been observed when Na(+) interacts with ion exchange resin. NMR also 
      indicates that about 60% of Na(+) of kidney and brain is complexed. Destruction 
      of cell structure of muscle by homogenization little alters the per cent 
      complexing of Na(+). NMR studies show that Na(+) is complexed by actomyosin, 
      which may be the molecular site of complexation of some Na(+) in muscle. The same 
      studies indicate that the solubility of Na(+) in the interstitial water of 
      actomyosin gel is markedly reduced compared with its solubility in liquid water, 
      which suggests that the water in the gel is organized into an icelike state by 
      the nearby actomyosin molecules. If a major fraction of intracellular Na(+) 
      exists in a complexed state, then major revisions in most theoretical treatments 
      of equilibria, diffusion, and transport of cellular Na(+) become appropriate.

AB  - We describe a rare case of isolated extraocular muscle ocular adnexal lymphoma of 
      a middle-aged female who presented with redness in the left eye associated with 
      progressive proptosis over one year. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit 
      indicated isolated enlargement of the left superior oblique (SO) muscle with an 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of (0.77 ± 0.11 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s). 
      Histopathology with immunohistochemical staining of the incisional biopsy from 
      the SO muscle belly confirmed the diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone B cell 
      lymphoma.

TI  - Effect of two eccentric hamstring exercises on muscle architectural 
      characteristics assessed with diffusion tensor MRI.
PG  - 393-406
LID - 10.1111/sms.14283 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a Nordic hamstring exercise or Diver 
      hamstring exercise intervention on biceps femoris long head, semitendinosus and 
      semimembranosus muscle's fascicle length and orientation through diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) with magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: In this three-arm, 
      single-center, randomized controlled trial, injury-free male basketball players 
      were randomly assigned to a Nordic, Diver hamstring exercise intervention or 
      control group. The primary outcome was the DTI-derived fascicle length and 
      orientation of muscles over 12 weeks. RESULTS: Fifty-three participants were 
      included for analysis (mean age 22 ± 7 years). Fascicle length in the 
      semitendinosus over 12 weeks significantly increased in the Nordic-group (mean 
      [M]: 20.8 mm, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 7.8 to 33.8) compared with the 
      Control-group (M: 0.9 mm, 95% CI: -7.1 to 8.9), mean between-groups difference: 
      19.9 mm, 95% CI: 1.9 to 37.9, p = 0.026. Fascicle orientation in the biceps 
      femoris long head over 12 weeks significantly decreased in the Diver-group (mean: 
      -2.6°, 95% CI: -4.1 to -1.0) compared with the Control-group (mean: -0.2°, 95% 
      CI: -1.4 to 1.0), mean between-groups difference: -2.4°, 95% CI: -4.7 to -0.1, 
      p = 0.039. CONCLUSION: The Nordic hamstring exercise intervention did 
      significantly increase the fascicle length of the semitendinosus and the Diver 
      hamstring exercise intervention did significantly change the orientation of 
      fascicles of the biceps femoris long head. As both exercises are complementary to 
      each other, the combination is relevant for preventing hamstring injuries.

      measurement with an MR imaging diffusion technique. Work in progress.
PG  - 871-4
AB  - To investigate temperature increases in tissues during magnetic resonance (MR) 
      imaging or spectroscopy, the authors measured temperature changes in vitro and in 
      vivo (leg of a volunteer) in a condition simulating hydrogen-1 decoupling in MR 
      spectroscopy. Noninvasive measurements were obtained by using the temperature 
      dependence of the translational diffusion coefficient of water. Temperature was 
      measured at 0.5 T (86 MHz) by using a stimulated-echo sequence that included 
      intense gradient pulses and a procedure reducing sensitivity to bulk tissue 
      motion. Calibration curves of the diffusion coefficient against 
      thermocouple-measured temperature were obtained for a gelatin phantom and bovine 
      muscle. Temperature changes were 5.3 degrees C +/- 0.5 at 2.5 cm from the coil in 
      gelatin and 7.7 degrees C +/- 0.5 at 0.7 cm in bovine muscle. The temperature 
      changed by 4.9 degrees C +/- 1.9 at 2.2 cm from the coil in the calf muscle of a 
      volunteer. The H-1 decoupling protocol can be adapted (modifications in 
      transmission power, duty cycle) to reduce heating effects to below safety 
      recommendations.

TI  - Rb/Sr isotopic and compositional retentivity of muscovite during deformation.
PG  - 161-178
LID - 10.1016/j.lithos.2015.04.007 [doi]
AB  - Permian metapegmatite muscovite from the Upper-Austroalpine Matsch Unit in 
      Southern Tyrol (Italy) was investigated regarding its Rb/Sr and compositional 
      retentivity during Cretaceous Upper-greenschist facies deformation. The data 
      imply that microstructurally relic Permian magmatic muscovite largely maintained 
      its major and trace element compositions during deformation, whereas the Rb/Sr 
      geochronometer is strongly affected by a net loss of Sr. Lower Sr concentrations 
      of muscovite correlate with higher (87)Rb/(86)Sr and (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios. In 
      most samples, the muscovite grain size- and magnetic-fractions with the lowest 
      (87)Rb/(86)Sr and (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios preserve a Permo-Triassic muscovite-whole 
      rock Rb/Sr apparent age interpreted as to reflect formation during or cooling 
      after pegmatite emplacement. Contrastingly, muscovite fractions with higher 
      (87)Rb/(86)Sr and (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios are arranged along a roughly linear array 
      with a positive correlation of the (87)Rb/(86)Sr and (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios in the 
      (87)Rb/(86)Sr vs (87)Sr/(86)Sr space. They yield successively lower 
      muscovite-whole rock Rb/Sr apparent ages. We explain the variations in the Rb/Sr 
      isotopic character of microstructurally relic muscovite by a, presumably 
      deformation-related, loss of Sr during the Cretaceous event. Contemporaneously, 
      only very limited amounts of isotopically different Sr from the matrix reservoir 
      might possibly have entered the muscovite. Consequently, the Rb/Sr of the relic 
      muscovite is affected by a net loss of Sr. The results imply that at temperatures 
      of < 500 °C, deformation is supposed to be the predominant factor in controlling 
      the Rb/Sr geochronometer of relic muscovite, by significantly reducing the 
      characteristic length scale for volume diffusion. However, variations of the 
      major and trace element compositions within Permian relic muscovite are 
      interpreted to rather reflect primary compositional instead of 
      deformation-related variations.

TI  - Modulation of luciferase activity using high intensity focused ultrasound in 
      combination with bioluminescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging and

LID - 10.1016/j.ultras.2009.02.009 [doi]
AB  - This study investigates the effect of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to 
      muscle tissue transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a 
      CMV-promoter. HIFU was applied to the transfected muscle tissue using a dual HIFU 
      system. In a first group four different intensities (802 W/cm2, 1401 W/cm2, 2117 
      W/cm2, 3067 W/cm2) of continuous HIFU were applied 20 s every other week for four 
      times. In a second group two different intensities (802 W/cm2, 1401 W/cm2) were 
      applied 20 s every fourth day for 20 times. The luciferase activity was 
      determined by bioluminescence imaging. The effect of HIFU to the muscle tissue 
      was assessed by T1-weighted +/- Gd-DTPA, T2-weighted and a diffusion-weighted 
      STEAM sequence obtained on a 1.5-T GE-MRI scanner. Histology of the treated 
      tissue was done at the end. In the first group the photon emission was at 3067.6 
      W/cm2 1.28 x 10(7) +/- 3.1 x 10(6) photon/s (5.5 +/- 1.2-fold), of 2157.9 W/cm2 
      8.1 +/- 2.7 x 10(6) photon/s (3.2 +/- 1.1-fold), of 1401.9 W/cm2 9.3 +/- 1.3 x 
      10(6) photon/s (4.9 +/- 0.4-fold) and of 802.0 W/cm2 8.6x +/- 1.2 x 10(6) 
      photon/s (4.5 +/- 0.6-fold) compared to baseline. In the second group the photon 
      emission was at 1401.9 W/cm2 and 802.0 W/cm2 14.1 +/- 3.6 x 10(6) photon/s (6.1 
      +/- 1.5-fold), respectively, 5.1 +/- 4.7 x 10(6) photon/s (6.5 +/- 2.0-fold). 
      HIFU can enhance the luciferase activity controlled by a CMV-promoter.

TI  - Isolation of terminal cisternae of frog skeletal muscle. Calcium storage and 
      release properties.
PG  - 9901-7
AB  - Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) terminal cisternae (TC) of frog (Rana esculenta) 
      fast-twitch skeletal muscle have been purified by isopycnic sucrose density 
      gradient centrifugation. Biochemical characteristics and Ca2+ release properties 
      have been investigated and compared to those of the homologous fraction of rabbit 
      skeletal muscle TC. The frog SR fraction obtained at the 38/45% sucrose interface 
      appears to be derived from the terminal cisternae region as judged by: (a) thin 
      section electron microscopy showing vesicles containing electron opaque material 
      and squarelike (feet) projections at the outer surface; (b) protein composition 
      (Ca2+-ATPase, calsequestrin, and high Mr proteins); (c) Ca2+ fluxes properties. 
      The content of calsequestrin was higher in frog TC by 50% and the Ca2+ binding 
      capacity (624 or 45 nmol of Ca2+/mg of TC protein, depending upon experimental 
      conditions) was 3-4 times that of rabbit TC. Species-specific antigenic 
      differences were found between junctional SR proteins of frog and rabbit TC. 
      After active Ca2+ preloading in the presence of pyrophosphate (Palade, P. (1987) 
      J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6135-6141), caffeine and doxorubicin elicited Ca2+ release 
      from either TC fraction but with much faster rates in frog TC than in rabbit TC 
      (14 versus 3 mumol of Ca2+/min/mg of protein). The present results provide new 
      evidence for the existence of marked differences in Ca2+ release properties 
      between TC of amphibian and mammalian fast-twitch muscle. Higher Ca2+ binding 
      capacity and faster release rates in frog TC might compensate for the comparably 
      greater diffusion distance being covered by the released Ca2+ from the Z-line to 
      the actomyosin cross-bridges in the A-I overlap region.

AB  - Films of conducting polymers when used as electrodes in an electrolytic solution 
      oxidize and reduce under the flow of anodic and cathodic currents, respectively. 
      The electrochemical reactions induce conformational movements of the chains, 
      generation or destruction of free volume and interchange of ions and solvent with 
      the electrolyte giving a gel that reacts, swells or shrinks. Electric pulses 
      acting on reactive gels constituted by polymers, solvent and ions are the closest 
      artificial materials to those that constitute actuating biological organs. The 
      electrochemical reaction under the flow of a constant current promotes a 
      progressive change of color, volume, porosity, stored charge and storage or 
      release of ions. The reaction is kinetically controlled by the conformational 
      movements or by the diffusion of counterions through the gel; it works under 
      electrochemical equilibrium and defines, at any intermediate oxidation state, 
      equilibrium potentials. Any variable (mechanical, chemical, optical, magnetic, 
      etc) acting on the equilibrium will induce a change in the working potential of 
      any device, driven by a constant current, based on this reaction; 
      actuating-sensing devices based on the electrochemical properties are expected. 
      Artificial muscles able to sense pushed weights, electrolyte concentration or 
      ambient temperature during actuation are described. The activation energy of the 
      reaction includes structural information and allows the obtention of the 
      conformational energy, the heart of both actuating and sensing properties.

TI  - Intra-median raphe infusions of muscimol and the substance P analogue DiMe-C7 
      produce hyperactivity: role of serotonin neurons.
PG  - 139-51
AB  - Injections into the midbrain median raphe nucleus (MR) of the metabolically 
      stable substance P analogue, DiMe-C7, produce dose-dependent increases in 
      locomotor activity (LMA). Ibotenic acid (8.0 micrograms in 2.0 microliter 
      vehicle) lesions of the MR block the hyperkinetic effects of optimal doses of 
      both DiMe-C7 (1.0 microgram in 0.5 microliter vehicle) and the GABAA agonist, 
      muscimol (100 ng in 0.5 microliter vehicle). This observation indicates that the 
      increases in LMA produced by intra-MR DiMe-C7 and muscimol infusion are not due 
      to diffusion to sites outside the MR. Intra-MR administration of the selective 
      serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (6.0 micrograms in 1.5 
      microliter vehicle), following pretreatment with the norepinephrine and dopamine 
      reuptake inhibitor, nomifensine maleate (15 mg/kg, i.p.), blocked the 
      hyperactivity induced by intra-MR infusions of DiMe-C7 (1.0 microgram) but not 
      that of muscimol (100 ng). These observations suggest that the LMA effects of 
      intra-MR DiMe-C7 and muscimol administration are mediated by different neural 
      mechanisms. The LMA effects of DiMe-C7 depend on intact 5-HT neurons in the MR, 
      whereas the effects of muscimol depend on intact non-5-HT MR cells.

TI  - Effect of Transducer Orientation on Errors in Ultrasound Image-Based Measurements 
      of Human Medial Gastrocnemius Muscle Fascicle Length and Pennation.
PG  - e0157273
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0157273 [doi]
LID - e0157273
AB  - Ultrasound imaging is often used to measure muscle fascicle lengths and pennation 
      angles in human muscles in vivo. Theoretically the most accurate measurements are 
      made when the transducer is oriented so that the image plane aligns with muscle 
      fascicles and, for measurements of pennation, when the image plane also 
      intersects the aponeuroses perpendicularly. However this orientation is difficult 
      to achieve and usually there is some degree of misalignment. Here, we used 
      simulated ultrasound images based on three-dimensional models of the human medial 
      gastrocnemius, derived from magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor images, to 
      describe the relationship between transducer orientation and measurement errors. 
      With the transducer oriented perpendicular to the surface of the leg, the error 
      in measurement of fascicle lengths was about 0.4 mm per degree of misalignment of 
      the ultrasound image with the muscle fascicles. If the transducer is then tipped 
      by 20°, the error increases to 1.1 mm per degree of misalignment. For a given 
      degree of misalignment of muscle fascicles with the image plane, the smallest 
      absolute error in fascicle length measurements occurs when the transducer is held 
      perpendicular to the surface of the leg. Misalignment of the transducer with the 
      fascicles may cause fascicle length measurements to be underestimated or 
      overestimated. Contrary to widely held beliefs, it is shown that pennation angles 
      are always overestimated if the image is not perpendicular to the aponeurosis, 
      even when the image is perfectly aligned with the fascicles. An analytical 
      explanation is provided for this finding.

TI  - Decreased water permeability of erythrocyte membranes in patients with Duchenne 
      muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 243-7
AB  - The water proton relaxation times of erythrocytes (T'2a) from 15 Duchenne 
      muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients and age-matched controls have been determined 
      by a pulse nuclear magnetic resonance technique. Statistically significant higher 
      values of T'2a were noted for the DMD erythrocytes, both in the presence or 
      absence of p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, a potent inhibitor of water 
      diffusion through erythrocyte membrane. As the values of T'2a are inversely 
      related to the water permeability, the results indicate a decreased permeability 
      of erythrocyte membrane in DMD. The findings are discussed in relation to the 
      molecular mechanisms of water diffusion across erythrocyte membrane and in regard 
      to the general problem of membrane abnormalities in DMD.

AB  - The rotational mobility of myoglobin in situ was determined by proton nuclear 
      magnetic resonance line width measurements of a characteristic myoglobin 
      resonance observed in bovine heart muscle spectra. The protein diffuses 
      intracellularly at nearly half the rate observed in dilute solution. This high 
      mobility allows the oxygenated form of myoglobin to contribute significantly to 
      the overall diffusive flux of oxygen in respiring heart muscle.

TI  - Imaging the microcirculatory proton fraction of muscle with diffusion-weighted 
      echo-planar imaging.
PG  - 27-32
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of exertional compartment syndrome is 
      challenging. In this feasibility study, diffusion-weighted echo-planar magnetic 
      resonance imaging was performed in human subjects to determine whether 
      alterations in the circulating blood volume of muscle secondary to exercise or 
      changes in compartment pressure could be visualized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      calf muscles of six subjects were studied before and after exercise and also 
      during the application of external pressure to the calf. Gated, single-shot, 
      diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (1.5 T) was implemented with signal 
      averaging. Parametric images of the "perfusion" fraction (f) were generated, and 
      regions of interest from anatomic compartments were analyzed. The precision of f 
      was estimated by using propagation of error analysis. RESULTS: Parametric images 
      depicted visible increases in the microcirculatory proton fraction (f) of calf 
      muscle after exercise (mean change, +0.016) and visible decreases in f on the 
      application of 40 mm Hg to the calf after exercise (mean change, -0.023). Mean 
      changes in f were only significantly different from zero for the group, however, 
      under conditions of applied pressure to the calf after exercise. Changes in f 
      were not significantly different across muscle compartments. The error variance 
      in f was approximately 0.01. CONCLUSION: Parametric images of f generated by 
      diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging may depict alterations in the circulating 
      blood volume of muscle induced by exercise and changes in compartment pressure. 
      The inherent imprecision of this technique, however, appears to limit its 
      clinical utility.

PG  - 867-83
AB  - This article investigates the quantitative predictive capabilities of 
      region-specific models by comparing experimental electrograms obtained from in 
      vivo mapping of the ventricular free wall with those obtained through simulation 
      of a region specific three-dimensional bidomain model that incorporates measured 
      fiber orientations. Epicardial electrograms were recorded from canine left 
      ventricles during and after unipolar pacing using a 528-channel electrode plaque. 
      Fiber directions throughout the tissue were estimated from diffusion-weighted MRI 
      and from pace mapping. Electrograms were computed in the bidomain model with 
      experimentally derived properties during paced activations at the same 
      spatiotemporal resolution as those recorded experimentally. Epicardial potentials 
      from model and experiment were directly compared, and sensitivities of these 
      comparisons to reference electrode location and to the choice of material 
      properties were analyzed. The comparisons performed here demonstrate, that (1) 
      the stimulus artifact can be used to estimate the in vivo myocardial fiber 
      architecture, (2) the correlation between simulated and experimental electrograms 
      decreases with increasing pacing depth, and (3) the quantitative comparisons 
      between bidomain model and experimental data are sensitive to both the 
      description of the fiber architecture, and the location of the unipolar reference 
      electrode, but relatively insensitive to moderate changes in the bidomain 
      conductivities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct recombinant expression plasmid with an antibacterial 
      peptide (attacin) mature peptide gene from Musca domestica and express an 
      antibacterial peptide attacin in Pichia pastoris. METHODS: The coding region of 
      attacin mature peptide was cloned into the expression vector pPIC9K. The 
      recombinant plasmid was linearized by digestion with Sac I and transformed into 
      P. pastoris GS115 by electroporation. The insert clones containing multiple 
      copies were selected with geneticin, pha, enotype and PCR. The expression of P. 
      pastoris GS115/pPIC9K-attacin were induced with methanol. The supernatant of the 
      expressed protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The 
      anti-bacterial activity of expression product was analyzed by agarose diffusion 
      assay. RESULTS: The expression plasmid was constructed and transformed into P. 
      pastoris GS115. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis indicated that the 
      recombinant containing recombinant plasmid pPIC9K-attacin expressed a Mr 22000 
      protein. The expression product inhibited the growth of E. coli K12D31. 
      CONCLUSION: The attacin gene from Musca domestica has been expressed in P. 
      pastoris.

TI  - Proteolytic dimers of porcine muscle lactate dehydrogenase: characterization, 
      folding, and reconstitution of the truncated and nicked polypeptide chain.
PG  - 1399-406
AB  - Lactate dehydrogenase from porcine skeletal muscle is a "dimer of dimers" that is 
      stabilized in its tetrameric state by an N-terminal "arm" of approximately 20 
      amino acid residues. Due to the low dissociation constant of the tetramer, the 
      dimer is inaccessible to direct analysis. Limited proteolysis during 
      reconstitution (after dissociation at pH 2.3) yields stable "dimers". As 
      suggested by affinity chromatography, these inactive dimers contain the 
      dinucleotide fold of native LDH. In the presence of structure-making ions, 
      approximately 40% activity is restored in the dimeric state [Girg, R., Jaenicke, 
      R., & Rudolph, R. (1983) Biochem. Int. 7, 443-444]. The cleavage yields about 
      equal amounts of three fragments, F 34, F 21, and F 14 (Mr 33.5K, 21.4K, and 
      13.5K, respectively). F 34 represents the intact chain lacking the N-terminal 
      10-11 amino acid residues; its C-terminus is heterogeneous, varying in the range 
      between residues 326 +/- 5. F 21 contains residues 11/12 to 200 +/- 3; F 14 is a 
      mixture of three subfragments: residues 11/12 to approximately 133, 38 to 
      approximately 163, and 208 to approximately 327. After solubilization in 6 M 
      guanidine hydrochloride, F 34 can be reconstituted to partially active dimers. 
      Reactivation is determined by slow subunit refolding with subsequent 
      diffusion-controlled dimerization, in accordance with the monomer-dimer 
      transition in the reconstitution mechanism of the intact tetramer. Reconstitution 
      of F 21 and F 14 is concentration dependent and leads to partially active "nicked 
      dimers", indicating that separate domains are able to reassociate correctly to 
      yield the native subunit arrangement.

TI  - Calcium binding of arterial tropomyosin: involvement in the thin filament 
      regulation of smooth muscle.
PG  - 5216-21
AB  - Bovine aortic tropomyosin has been isolated by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography 
      following isoelectric precipitation and ammonium sulfate fractionation. A single 
      polypeptide [Mr 36 000 on a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel] was 
      obtained under different electrophoretic conditions. The amino acid composition 
      of bovine tropomyosin was very similar to that of rabbit skeletal muscle; the 
      amino-terminal residue is blocked. The molecular weight of the native tropomyosin 
      (76 000), which is twice that calculated from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, 
      suggests that the molecule is a dimer. The diffusion coefficient of 3.4 X 10(-7) 
      cm2 s-1 and the frictional coefficient of 1.7 indicate that the molecule is 
      asymmetric. Comparative high-pressure liquid chromatography peptide mapping of 
      rabbit skeletal and bovine aortic tropomyosins shows primary structure variation. 
      Bovine aortic tropomyosin binds calcium under physiological conditions of pH and 
      ionic strength (22 mol of Ca2+/mol of tropomyosin with a Kd of 1.4 mM). Such a 
      property is not shared by skeletal tropomyosin. In low Mg2+ concentration, both 
      skeletal and aortic actin activations of the skeletal myosin ATPase activity are 
      calcium independent. Addition of aortic tropomyosin to a hybrid actomyosin 
      (aortic actin, skeletal myosin) yields an enhancement of the actin activation of 
      the myosin ATPase activity, but the addition of skeletal tropomyosin yields a 
      decrease of this activity. However, both the enhancement and decrease are calcium 
      dependent. Addition of skeletal or aortic tropomyosin to an actomyosin system, 
      where both actin and myosin come from skeletal muscle, yields only an enhancement 
      of the actin activation of the myosin ATPase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - The structural isomerisation of human-muscle adenylate kinase as studied by 
      1H-nuclear magnetic resonance.
PG  - 531-6
AB  - Human muscle adenylate kinase (ATP:AMP phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.4.3.) was 
      studied by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The C-2 and C-4 proton 
      resonances of the active-center histidine His-36 could be identified; the pK of 
      His-36 was determined as 6.1. The pK of His-189 is very low (4.9) although it is 
      located at the surface of the protein. Other resonance lines are discussed in 
      comparison with NMR spectra of porcine adenylate kinase [McDonald et al. (1975) 
      J. Biol. Chem. 250, 6947-6954]. A pH-dependent structural isomerization as shown 
      by X-ray crystallography in the pig enzyme [Pai et al. (1977) J. Mol. Biol. 114, 
      37-45] was not observed for human adenylate kinase in solution. However, the 
      binding of adenosine(5')pentaphospho(5')adenosine (Ap5A), a bisubstrate 
      inhibitor, to adenylate kinase causes an overall change of the NMR spectrum 
      indicative of a large conformational change of the enzyme. The exchange rate 
      (koff) for Ap5A was estimated as 10 s-1 and decreases by addition of Mg2+. On the 
      basis of these values and the known dissociation constant it is likely that the 
      binding of Ap5A is a diffusion-controlled process kon being 10(8) M-1 s-1. In 
      conclusion, the system Ap5A/Mg2+/human adenylate kinase, which has been studied 
      by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction in parallel, is suitable for analyzing 
      the induced fit postulated by Jencks for all kinase-catalyzed reactions.

TI  - Studies of water permeability and proteins of erythrocyte membranes in patients 
      with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 294-301
AB  - The characteristics of water permeability of erythrocytes from 54 Duchenne 
      muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients and age-matched controls have been determined 
      by a pulse nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. A decreased permeability 
      of erythrocyte membrane in DMD was definitely found at all temperatures between 
      15 and 42 degrees C, with normal values for the activation energy of water 
      diffusion. No differences between DMD and control subjects in the pattern of 
      erythrocyte membrane polypeptides separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis 
      could be detected. The findings are discussed in relation to the molecular 
      mechanisms of water diffusion across erythrocyte membrane and the problem of 
      erythrocyte membrane abnormalities in DMD. A new interpretation of erythrocyte 
      membrane alterations is proposed based on the recent findings regarding the 
      molecular pathology of DMD.

TI  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy carriers. Proton spin-lattice relaxation times of 
      skeletal muscles on magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 373-6
AB  - By means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the proton spin-lattice relaxation 
      times (T1 values) of the skeletal muscles were measured in Duchenne muscular 
      dystrophy (DMD) carriers and normal controls. The bound water fraction (BWF) was 
      calculated form the T1 values obtained, according to the fast proton diffusion 
      model. In the DMD carriers, T1 values of the gluteus maximus and quadriceps 
      femoris muscles were significantly higher, and BWFs of these muscles were 
      significantly lower, than in normal control. Degenerative muscular changes 
      accompanied by interstitial edema were presumed responsible for this abnormality. 
      No correlation was observed between the muscle T1 and serum creatine kinase 
      values. The present study showed that MRI could be a useful method for studying 
      the dynamic state of water in both normal and pathological skeletal muscles. Its 
      possible utility for DMD carrier detection was discussed briefly.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging of muscular involvement in juvenile dermatomyositis: 
      case report.
PG  - 315-20
AB  - A case of 5 year old juvenile patient with dermatomyositis together with 
      conventional and diffusion-weighted MRI images is reported. The reported case was 
      atypical for the pattern of involvement of the accompanying oedema which was 
      affecting distal parts of the extremities and anterior muscle groups. 
      Electromyography was negative. The case confirmed by a pathologist demonstrates 
      the use of diffusion weighted imaging in determining unequivocal oedema and its 
      exact extent.

TI  - Deformability and cell membrane properties of erythrocytes in Duchenne muscular 
      dystrophy.
PG  - 139-47
AB  - In many investigations of the hypothesis of a membrane defect in Duchenne 
      muscular dystrophy, the erythrocyte has been the cell of choice, but reported 
      abnormalities in the Duchenne erythrocyte are disputed. Techniques of 
      microsieving, cell surface staining and measurement of cell water diffusion 
      turnover rate have been used in this investigation to examine erythrocyte 
      properties. Measurements of pressure drop-velocity relations were carried out in 
      a capillary pore rheometer using pure erythrocyte suspensions. The study showed 
      that Duchenne erythrocytes do not behave differently from normal, results which 
      are in substantial agreement with similar microsieving studies. A nuclear 
      magnetic resonance method was used to measure cell water diffusion efflux which, 
      using our cell surface data, could be related to cell membrane permeability. 
      Under normal conditions and conditions of chemical interference with the membrane 
      protein, the results revealed that the membrane pathways involved in water 
      diffusion in Duchenne erythrocytes are unaltered.

TI  - A cryptic pathogenic NDUFV1 variant identified by RNA-seq in a patient with 
      normal complex I activity in muscle and transient magnetic resonance imaging 
      changes.
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.63170 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders (MRC) are amongst the most common group 
      of inborn errors of metabolism. MRC, of which complex I deficiency accounts for 
      approximately a quarter, are very diverse, causing a wide range of clinical 
      problems and can be difficult to diagnose. We report an illustrative MRC case 
      whose diagnosis was elusive. Clinical signs included failure to thrive caused by 
      recurrent vomiting, hypotonia and progressive loss of motor milestones. Initial 
      brain imaging suggested Leigh syndrome but without expected diffusion 
      restriction. Muscle respiratory chain enzymology was unremarkable. Whole-genome 
      sequencing identified a maternally inherited NDUFV1 missense variant [NM_007103.4 
      (NDUFV1):c.1157G > A; p.(Arg386His)] and a paternally inherited synonymous 
      variant [NM_007103.4 (NDUFV1):c.1080G > A; (p.Ser360=)]. RNA sequencing 
      demonstrated aberrant splicing. This case emphasizes the diagnostic odyssey of a 
      patient in whom a confirmed diagnosis was elusive because of atypical features 
      and normal muscle respiratory chain enzyme (RCE) activities, along with a 
      synonymous variant, which are often filtered out from genomic analyses. It also 
      illustrates the following points: (1) complete resolution of magnetic resonance 
      imaging changes may be part of the picture in mitochondrial disease; (2) analysis 
      for synonymous variants is important for undiagnosed patients; and (3) RNA-seq is 
      a powerful tool to demonstrate pathogenicity of putative splicing variants.

TI  - Determination of muscle fibre orientation using Diffusion-Weighted MRI.
PG  - 5-10
AB  - Biomechanical studies have shown that the distribution of stress and strain in 
      biological tissue is strongly dependent on fibre orientation. Therefore, to 
      analyze the local mechanical load, accurate data on muscle fibre orientation are 
      needed. Traditional techniques to determine fibre orientation are inherently 
      invasive. Here we used Diffusion Weighted MRI to non-invasively determine, in 
      each image voxel of 0.23 x 0.23 mm, the diffusion tensor of water in the cat 
      semimembranosus muscle. The direction corresponding to the largest eigenvector of 
      this tensor was calculated. This direction was found to correspond qualitatively 
      to the muscular fibre direction, as determined by visual inspection.
